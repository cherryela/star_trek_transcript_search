M'BENGA: Years ago, I was
stationed on the moon of J'Gal.

ROR'QUEG: If you had served on J'Gal,

you'd be dead.

We both served in the Klingon w*r.

A hundred million Federation
bodies, slaughtered.

- I don't know.

Shut up.

Sorry. I'm working on that.

CHAPEL: You sure you
want to do this again?

M'BENGA: Again? No.

[EXHALES SLOWLY]

[GRUNTING]

The w*r is over, Joseph.

Yes, but how can it ever be?

PIKE: Captain's Log stardate . .

The Enterprise has arrived
at the Prospero system

for a rendezvous with the Kelcie Mae

in order to pick up a special visitor.

Prospero has been under
Starfleet jurisdiction

since the end of the Klingon w*r.

After years of infighting,
all three planets

have finally reached
a cease-fire agreement,

negotiated by a unique
Federation ambassador.

Enterprise has been tasked with

transporting the
ambassador to Starbase .

Our orders are to make him feel welcome.

However...

our esteemed guest is a Klingon,

a former general who
defected to our side.

Most of my crew didn't fight in the w*r,

but some did.

[BOATSWAIN'S WHISTLE BLOWS]

PIKE: Ambassador Dak'Rah,

Son of Ra'Ul, it is my honor

to welcome you aboard
the USS Enterprise.

It's just Rah.

Formal Klingon names are a mouthful.

What is that peculiar device?

Ah, the boatswain's whistle.

An old Earth custom from
the time of ships at sea.

It's become somewhat of a
tradition here on Enterprise

for our most distinguished guests.

Uh, I see.

Kind of like rolling the red carpet out?

[CHUCKLES] Yes.

Yes, exactly like that.

We want to extend every
courtesy the ship has to offer.

- Mm.
- My head of security

is ready to escort you to quarters.

Captain Christopher Pike,
if you wouldn't mind,

I've heard so many great things
about the Federation flagship.

Could I trouble you for
a brief tour of the ship?

The Summit of Scorpi Ten,

the Klingon Free-Trade Agreement,

negotiating the Perez Accords.

Sure, he's done some stuff.

UHURA: He's an effective voice

in spreading Starfleet's
message for unity.

A former enemy speaking on our behalf?

It's incredible.

Or it's a long con to gain
access to Federation secrets.

[SIGHS] Just because he's Klingon...

Trust me, I know Klingons.

This guy with the peace
treaties, that's not Klingon.

So you don't trust Ambassador Rah

because he believes in peace?

That's not what... Mm.

Ha ha.

The slaughter at Lembatta Five.

The siege at Starbase Zetta. Athos...

[ORTEGAS SIGHS]

I didn't mean to hit a nerve.

It's okay. You're right.

I don't really know what he's about.

All I know is the stories,

like that he k*lled his own
men to cover his retreat.

There's a reason other Klingons
call him the Butcher of J'Gal.

Captain on the bridge.

What an amazing view.

A Bird-of-Prey isn't built
to take in its surroundings.

Klingons will never admit it,

but the Federation
has much better ships.

Well, our ships are designed
primarily for exploration.

Ah, but this one,

- I bet, is fun to fly.
- [CHUCKLES]

Lieutenant Erica Ortegas here is
our senior officer at the helm.

A beautiful ship, Lieutenant.

And I'm sure it's in good hands.

Thank you, sir. I do my best.

Captain, may we continue the tour?

I don't want to distract your
bridge crew from their duties.

As you were.

This one's cold.

It is a simple matter of coding.

We will have ample time to
work out the inconsistencies

before presenting
this to the ambassador.

Not as much time as you think.

My science officer has been
preparing a small surprise

to make you feel more at home.

Mr. Spock?

Ambassador Rah, it is an honor.

In anticipation of your visit,
we are attempting to produce

a popular caffeinated
beverage from Kronos.

UNA: On a recent mission,

Spock was able to parley
with a Klingon captain

and procure a recipe.

I must admit, it has
ignited a curiosity in me,

a desire to experience
more of your culture.

There's nothing to experience.

They're a warmongering
race limited by ideology.

I have breached a complicated subject.

Please accept my apology.

No, no, no. I... apologize.

My distaste for the
past colors my words.

No, I appreciate this kind gesture,

and I would love to try the raktajino.

[BEEPING]

I think perhaps we should
let this cool a bit.

We are still working out the coding.

One good thing about Klingons,

we have a high tolerance for pain.

Still, if you would indulge me.

Is it true that all peace negotiations

Peace is not a destination.

It's a journey. It's a state of mind.

SPOCK: Quite understandable.

I do not know much about your
service in the w*r, but...

I am available to you if you
ever feel the need to share.

Yeah, I don't, so let's just

peace he's managed.

I can help with that.

ORTEGAS: He's not wrong.

I was stationed near Prospero.

They are pretty stubborn.

They are stubborn. Correct.

- Often badly.
- Ambassador Rah,

are you familiar with
the ancient Earth text

Sun Tzu's The Art of w*r?

A most inspired human masterpiece.

I would love to hear your
views on its comparison

with the Klingon
manuscript mL' parmaq Qoj.

This is a most excellent topic
of conversation, Mr. Spock. Yes.

All Klingon children learn mL'
parmaq Qoj practically from birth.

I was introduced when I was seven.

My father taught me w*r and bloodshed,

but my mother taught
me to see and feel...

[CONVERSATION CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]

Better make that two.

- Mine's a double.
- Even better.

Why are we here?

You know why.

Our captain needs us.

Why is it so hard to explain
to people who weren't there?

[DISTANT EXPLOSIONS]

General Dak'Rah.

- His men wouldn't let me die.
- That was then.

Now you're here.

Got it?

Focus on getting better.

How's your chest feeling?

Like someone squeezed my
heart with their fingers.

Someone did.

Where are you from, Ensign?

New Angeles.

Terra Luna?

You're a long way from the shipyards.

We all just call it the Moon.

I have to go check on other patients.

When I come back, I want
to hear more about the Moon.

The answer is no.

And tell them to stop sending people.

Nobody sent me.

In fact, they said you'd
turn me down if I tried.

Good.

We're done here.

General Dak'Rah, son of Ra'Ul.

I need help taking him out.

Intel says he's head of
the house here on J'Gal,

running the entire
operation for the Klingons.

M'Benga, they're k*lling civilians.

Human and Klingon, it doesn't matter.

This General Dak'Rah,

he's ordering his men to k*ll on sight

anyone that isn't a Klingon soldier.

After they t*rture them.

What are you doing,
hiding behind the wire?

Everyone knows the stories.

The most hand-to-hand kills confirmed.

I'm just a doctor now.

I prefer saving lives to taking them.

And I need quick and silent.

I need you.

I gave you my answer.

Protocol .

It was discontinued.

Starfleet won't make it anymore,
but I heard you still have some.

- You heard wrong.
- You designed it, right?

Make more.

Even if I could, I wouldn't.

It turns out that pumping your body

full of adrenaline and pain inhibitors

is bad for your health.

I'd rather die tomorrow than today.

Come on, be reasonable.
My team needs an edge.

RAH: The negotiations almost fell apart

when the chancellor said to me,

"How is it that a Klingon

is speaking on behalf
of the Federation?"

[PIKE CHUCKLES]

That's a good question.
How did you respond?

I simply told him the truth.

Who I am and who I was.

And what the Federation did for me.

It saved my life.

J'Gal changed me.

J'Gal changed a lot of us.

You were on J'Gal?

I was.

The final conflict.

And the m*ssacre of Colony Athos.

RAH: Then you both know
my pain all too well.

Those were difficult times.

After what happened on
Athos, my ideals shifted.

The fighting was without merit.

It was pointless.

w*r is never the ideal option.

Is it true?

The story about what
you had to do to escape?

We were all pushed to our limits.

To the survivors of J'Gal.

[SPEAKS KLINGON]

"We are Klingon, may we endure"?

"Remain Klingon."

Remember that?

It was our battle cry during the w*r.

"Remain Klingon" is much
easier to shout in our language.

[REPEATS KLINGON PHRASE]

"Remain Klingon," all over the comms,

and then... [CLICKS TONGUE]

Boom. All your friends are dead.

Lieutenant Ortegas, stand down.

Captain?

RAH: Let us all

step back.

I...

I've heard worse.

Now I am simply hoping
to make up for my past,

and...

and connecting with others
who need healing like you.

[SCOFFS]

Okay, I am gonna go see
if she needs anything.

My sincere apologies, Ambassador Rah.

RAH: None are needed, Captain.

As I said, I bear no grudge.

Uh, sh-she will find
her own way to peace.

UHURA: Your perspective,

it bears a remarkable similarity
to Aenar existentialism.

RAH: Yes.

I love the Aenar.

Brilliant pacifists.

Doctor, maybe you should
check on Erica as well.

Chapel might need a
hand calming her down.

Aye, Captain.

Your security officer,
La'An, she tells me that

the two of you are practicing
full impact Mok'bara,

and I was wondering if we
might arrange a session.

I'll check my schedule.

Thank you.

You should be in bed.

What are we doing here, Doc?

Why did you join Starfleet, Ensign?

To explore.

Learn.

I don't know... none of the
stuff that I've been doing lately.

I joined to find new
ways of healing people.

With Starfleet, you learn

how the rest of the
universe treats its maladies.

And this w*r, it's a disease

eating at the heart of the Federation.

If we let the Klingons conquer
every colony in the sector,

they won't stop.

They won't go back to Kronos.

All of us have to remember

what we love most about back home.

We fight for them.

We fight hoping it doesn't change us.

Hoping...

... don't come home different.

But if we don't fight,

we don't win.

The disease takes over.

And none of us have
a home to go back to.

I just wish we could stop
this without all this dying.

We have to fight

so the people we love can
have a chance to live in peace.

That's Starfleet.

chance to take control of J'Gal.

Trask's team is going dark

while ground units
mount a huge offensive

near Colony Athos to provide cover.

All they need is meat for the grinder.

My platoon is leading the charge.

Fighting is one thing, but this...

This is the mission, remember?

I don't question orders.

It's a su1c1de run.

I can put you down for
mandatory convalescence.

- Where's your C.O.?
- Don't.

Forget before.

It was the dr*gs. I was tired.

Thanks for the patch up job.

Stay low.

Fight hard.

I'm a soldier, Doc.

This is what I do.

Eyes up, people!

We got the word, and the word is now.

Check the battle plans,
check assignments.

We all know the drill.

SPOCK: I want to apologize

for my part in last night's dinner.

You don't need to apologize.

None of this is about you.

You just see me going through something,

and our closeness makes
you feel responsible.

You're not.

I understand.

That is not true.

I am having difficulty

watching you experience
such obvious distress.

I want to help.

But it would appear all that
I am doing is making it worse.

w*r, it doesn't leave you. It...

It can, it can bury itself,
but it's-it's always there.

I researched J'Gal.

It was a forward operating base.

The data suggests the loss of
life was disproportionate...

J'Gal is not a statistic, Spock.

J'Gal is what it is.

w*r, it makes sense
if you've been there,

but it will never make sense.

Like I've been trying to tell you,

I just need some personal time.

wire, use it to get out.

Good luck.

♪

I've just been informed
that my time on the ship

is being cut short.

We don't have as much
time as I had hoped

to get to know one another.

I'm okay with that.

I don't need to know any
more than I already do.

Now...

please go away.

I thought that as victims of
the horrors of J'Gal, that...

Stop!

I know why you're here.

You want me to make you feel okay.

To say you've done enough.

You misunderstand me.

Oh, I understand you,

General Dak'Rah,

son of Ra'Ul.

Perhaps you do.

I sense that we are the same.

You're letting your
pain cloud your judgment.

Please.

Leave me alone.

Don't let hate ruin your soul.

You gave the order!

Anyone not a Klingon
soldier is the enemy.

You gave the order.

Yes, this is true.

But I've been doing the best I can

to make up for my transgressions.

Kiff didn't fight the hardest.

It was Captain Ruh'lis.

He held me back while
you made your escape.

- [BLADE SLICING, STABBING]
- [GRUNTING]

You turned me into a monster.

I told you I was there.

I am the Butcher of J'Gal.

No.

All of this time...

All of this time, you've said nothing.

You let me take credit.

Because, unlike you, I
am ashamed of that night.

I am ashamed of my cowardice.

I looked for you.

And now here you are,

using the blood on my hands
to make yourself a saint.

I only wanted Starfleet to trust me.

Look at the work that I've done.

People need saints.

They need belief.

If people knew the truth,
my work would be undone.

Your work is built on lies.

You never paid for what you did.

When I was at my lowest,
the Federation was there.

I need it, and they need me.

I have a purpose now.

Why did you have to come?

Why couldn't you leave me alone?

M'Benga, I'm here to provide healing.

Please, let me have a
chance to help you heal.

M'BENGA: I said no.

RAH [GRUNTING]: Don't be stupid.

M'BENGA [GRUNTING]:
You're a w*r criminal.

- RAH: Don't you see it?
- M'BENGA: Get your hands off!

RAH: So selfish a human!

M'BENGA: Don't!

[EXHALES WEAKLY]

I was there.

Saw the whole thing.

Rah wanted to talk, but Joseph was done.

He told Rah he didn't want to
be involved with a w*r criminal.

Guess hearing that set him off.

I can't believe he would
do something like this.

COMPUTER: Commander
Kiff, Klingon, deceased.

Captain Ruh'lis, Klingon, deceased.

Ambassador Dak'Rah, Klingon, deceased.

The Kn*fe belongs to the
Butcher of J'Gal, right?

Starfleet records tell us

the DNA belongs to the
three warlords he k*lled.

And I checked the
logs, tracked movements.

They corroborate the timeline.

I'm just shocked

that Rah would att*ck him like that.

I guess it just goes to show,

no one ever really knows

what goes on in anyone's heart.

♪

Joseph.

La'An's submitting her report.

Uh, there's likely to
be an inquiry, but...

Oh, we've known each other...

- How long?
- Too long to count.

Yeah, I'd like to think,

if you did instigate the fight with Rah,

if it got away from you
somehow, you could talk to me.

I'd be on your side. We'd work it out.

I didn't start the fight, Chris.

This whole situation, it's...

it's complicated.

Is it?

Rah was living a lie.

I saw his true face.

What if I told you he m*rder children?

Not his men.

He did it.

What if I started the fight then?

Would that be so bad?

Even if he had secrets,
there's due process.

That's why we have tribunals.

The Diplomatic Corps knew who he was,

and they still let him
represent the Federation.

The Federation believes everyone
deserves a second chance.

What about justice?

What about the victims?

Doesn't everyone deserve
to pay for their actions?

So who decides, hmm?

Who pays and who gets redemption?

Where's the line?

[CHUCKLES] You're right, Chris.

We've known each other
for a very long time,

see eye to eye on most things.

But you haven't lived my life.

You have the privilege

of believing in what's best in people.

Me?

I happen to know there are
some things in this world

that don't deserve forgiveness.

What are you saying?

I told you, I didn't start the fight.

But I'm glad he's dead.

M'BENGA: Chief Medical
Officer's Log, stardate . .

Biobed two is working again.

At least for now.

But I know it's only a matter of time

before it shuts down again.

Some things break in a way
that can never be repaired.

Only managed.
