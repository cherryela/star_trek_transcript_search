Starfleet would've warned them first.

Something about the
flares brought 'em out.

SAM: With locusts, environmental factors

can trigger a swarming instinct,
causing them to consume.

What if it's the same with the Gorn?

CMEs, in certain sequences,
set off a consumption cycle?

Are you suggesting they
invaded because of...

- SAM: You showed us

how they communicate
ship-to-ship through light.

What if they evolved with some deep,

Commander? Can we talk to you
and Lieutenant Spock, please?

SPOCK: You've determined the
source of the interference field?

Not exactly.

We've determined the location
from which the field emanates.

SHORT VERSION: by adjusting our output,

we triangulated the point of
origin of the countersignals.

PELIA: Now, we don't have any photos,

because it's on the
far side of the planet.

But we do know it's not native.

There's no structure indicated

on any colony maps in that location.

I'm betting it's some kind
of machine the Gorn brought.

If we can destroy it,

we can resume comms
and transporter signals.

Only problem I can see,
is there's no way for us

to use w*apon on it without
getting into a larger w*r.

We can't fire w*apon,

but we already know

that the Gorn don't
respond to space debris.

So, all we have to do is find
a way to get a piece of debris,

large enough to survive reentry,
to crash into that structure.

The saucer section of the Cayuga.

- Mm-hmm.
- My goodness.

If you had answered
like that in my class,

I would've given you an A-plus.

With the right calculations

and a few well-placed retro rockets,

we can make it appear that

Cayuga's orbit is decaying naturally.

Just more space junk,
burning up in the atmosphere.

PELIA: While it is
descending to the surface,

we can make a few last-minute
attitude adjustments

so that it will crash
exactly where we want it to.

UHURA: And by the time the
Gorn realize what's happened,

- it'll be too late.
- We can beam our people up

and get the hell out of here.

SPOCK: Placing those rockets
is a near impossible task.

No human can do this.

I, however, can.

- Spock.
- The commander and the ensign are right.

If we want to rescue our
people on the surface,

this is our best chance.

I know losing Christine is hard, but...

Yes, I am upset.

But I have not given in to grief yet.

Logic dictates we do not
know Chapel's or Batel's fate.

And until we do, the best chance

we have to save them is
if Enterprise takes out

I might need to break the quadrocoupler.

[STRAINING]: I can probably...

borrow another from the shield array.

If I didn't use it already.

Marie, talk to me.

Why did that Gorn run away?

I don't know, Chris.

Hey.

I came all the way here to find you.

Trust me with the truth.

[SIGHS]

It happened yesterday.

BATEL: I can't go with
you, you know that.

- You know what'll happen.
- You can't make this decision.

I won't endanger your
crew or the survivors.

It's what Hemmer did, Chris.

- Hemmer...
- He understood.

He was brave, but he
didn't give us a choice.

Here's my choice.

We free the device,
install it in your shuttle,

I fly it into the
Gorn tower, destroy it,

and you and the rest of the
survivors beam to Enterprise.

There's got to be a way to save you.

You have to let us at least try.

Marie...

SCOTTY: I don't mean to interrupt,

[WHIRRING]

The field is gone!

Transporters and comms are back on line!

SPOCK [OVER COMM]: Spock to
transporter, two to beam aboard

- as soon as possible.
- UHURA: Two?

Acknowledged and relayed, Lieutenant.

UNA: Number One to Pike, do you read?

PIKE [OVER COMM]: Boy, am I glad

to hear your voice, Number One.

UNA: No time to waste, Chris.

I don't know how much time we have
before the Gorn react.

I need you to track the colonists,
and beam them up.

They're in a building two klics
south-by-southwest.

What about you?

Three to beam up directly to sickbay.

We'll need a med team

and have Pelia meet us there, too.

Acknowledged.

♪

UNA: Welcome back, both of you.

Hate to do this to you, Nurse Chapel,

but we need you in sickbay
ASAP, and, Mr. Spock,

we could use your help on
the bridge right about now.

- Copy that.
- Understood, Commander.

Christine.

- I'm sorry.
- Don't. Save it.

There'll be time later.

♪

Christine?

You have no idea how
happy I am to see you.

Same here. What's happening?

Captain Batel is in need
of immediate sedation.

We'll also need a stasis field.

[WHISPERS]: Christine, if
there's one sign we can't stop it,

I need you to take me out.

I'm not giving up on her.

I have no intention of doing that.

Oh, uh, Commander Pelia,
this is Lieutenant Scott.

He needs your help.

Hello, Scotty.

- Professor.
- You two know each other?

One of my best students,

who sadly received
some of my worst grades.

Well, I'll leave you to it.

The hell is this supposed to be?

Something that could help
us hide from the Gorn.

- Oh.
- If we can fix it.

Captain on the bridge.

Wish it were better circumstances.

Just in time for more bad news.

A Gorn destroyer arrived in orbit.

We're facing four ships.

SPOCK: Long-range scans
have revealed more Gorn ships

in the vicinity, arriving in minutes.

Evasive maneuvers.

Uhura, I need to get a priority message

to Starfleet. We've
learned some critical intel

about the Gorn that they need to know.

Aye, Captain, I'll open a channel.

Number One, I need to buy time

to transport La'An,
Ortegas, Kirk, M'Benga,

and all the colonists off the planet.

Captain, the transporter
is not currently picking up

anyone on the surface.

- What?
- There's been no evacuation of any kind.

We have been scanning
since you first called.

We read no human life
signs on Parnassus Beta.

That's impossible, there are
hundreds of them. Check again.

I'm reading residual
transport signatures

from the center of the
town, non-Starfleet.

- What are you saying?
- The colonists and the landing party

appear to have been beamed up...

by the Gorn.
