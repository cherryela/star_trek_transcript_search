Previously on Star Trek:
Strange New Worlds...

SPOCK: You saw the future?

PIKE: I know exactly how
and when my life ends.

And I didn't just see it,

I felt it, every agonizing second.

Don't throw your life away, Chris.

I made a choice.

I accepted my fate.

What if you're wrong?

What if your fate is what you make it?

- I hear you speak languages.
- .

I found early that, if I
wanted to be understood,

it's best to communicate
in someone's own tongue.

So, I learned them.

HEMMER: Doctor, I need to check

your emergency medical transporter

for systems integration
and excess power usage.

Please stop messing around in here!

Hemmer's diagnostic

shows you're keeping something
in the pattern buffer.

- Rukiya, my daughter.
- Hi, Dad.

M'BENGA: You can't
imagine what it's like

to watch your child wither away.

And somewhere is a planet
that has the discovery I need.

PIKE: Captain's log, stardate . .

We have arrived at the Majalan system,

a minor star cluster at the
edge of Federation space.

I was last here ten years ago,

on a rescue mission.

When a pulsar nearly kills you,

you tend not to forget.

Our mission today is a
routine cartographic survey.

I expect it will be a lot quieter.

- Captain.
- Cadet Uhura.

You all right?

Oh, it's... nothing.

Just a little sore
after combat training.

Ah, right. You're on rotation

with Lieutenant
Noonien-Singh this week.

Lesson one of security?

"A Rigelian tiger
pounces with no warning."

Yeah. [LAUGHS] I learned
that one, all right.

Well, I've come to understand
La'An has a lot to teach.

Although...

keep your eye out for lesson seven.

What's lesson seven?

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

[BOATSWAIN'S WHISTLE BLOWS]

Nice of you to join us, Cadet.

Did you find your break restful?

Super restful, thanks for asking.

Lesson two of security...

"There are no breaks in security

because threats never take breaks."

UNA: Captain, we're
receiving a distress call

from a non-Federation shuttle.

They say they're under att*ck.

From who?

Scans indicate a small combat cruiser.

Light armaments. Non-Federation ID.

Shields up and take us closer, Erica.

Ensign Shankar, hail that cruiser.

No response, sir.

PIKE: Then get me an open channel.

This is Christopher Pike
of the USS Enterprise.

You are committing an act of aggression.

As the other vessel has
appealed to us for help,

I am obliged by both Federation law

and my own conscience to intervene.

I order you to stand down.

Damage?

Negligible. Shield
integrity is only down . %.

Red alert and evasive maneuvers.

Aye, Captain.

Captain, they... appear to
be making an att*ck run at us.

It's the little dog
with the most to prove.

Sir?

It's an expression.

You think you can take out their w*apon

without blowing them to smithereens?

Charge phasers.

- Minimum capacity.
- Charging.

- They're locking phasers again, Captain.
- Fire.

UHURA: Apologies.

Captain, I was trying to graze them,

but they fired and changed
course right into our w*apon.

I think they got the hint.

f*ring three times on a Starfleet ship.

If it wasn't our business
before, it is now.

Sir, shuttle is hailing us,
requesting immediate evacuation.

Their life support systems are failing.

Prepare to beam them aboard.

Let's go meet our guests.

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

Deck Six.

Lieutenant Pike?

Alora?

You know her, Captain?

Or should I call you Lieutenant?

PIKE: Space.

The final frontier.

These are the voyages of
the starshipEnterprise.

Its five-year mission:

to explore strange new worlds...

... to seek out new life

and new civilizations,

to boldly go where no
one has gone before.

PIKE: Alora and I met years ago.

ALORA: He rescued me
from another shuttle.

Seems like you have
bad luck with shuttles.

Or good,

depending on how you look at it.

[CHUCKLES]

Well, allow me to welcome
you all to Enterprise.

Your, uh,

new uniform is...

... very yellow.

Oh, it's gold, technically,

because I'm, um... [LAUGHS]

I'm a captain. So...

Well, on behalf of Majalis,
we thank you for your help...

... Captain Pike.

Uh, this is my Number One.

Una... Uh, Lieu-Lieutenant
Commander Una Chin-Riley.

Allow me to take you to
the ready room to debrief.

But first, I must insist

you take us to your medical facility.

Of course, right away.

Uh, Chief Kyle will escort you down.

Uh, sorry, are you the boy's father?

Strictly in a biological sense.

"When King Ridley turned,

the Wizard Pollux pushed him

- right over the cliff!"
- RUKIYA: Daddy.

You just read me the same
exact chapter twice in a row.

I did?

Darling...

... you know how I've
been keeping your pattern

in the transporter buffer,

so you don't keep getting sicker?

- Yes.
- Well...

I can't keep you out
of there for very long,

and sometimes it's hard to
keep track of the details.

Sometimes, you put me back
in when I don't notice?

So, how long have you
really been reading to me?

A while.

I've put the transport
system on a timer,

so as to not be disruptive.

When will it...

- [DOOR CHIMES]
- Come.

Doctor.

We've got people coming
in with possible injuries.

ALORA: First Servant
is a very special child.

A holy figure.

Chosen at birth by lottery
to embody our maxim:

science, service, sacrifice.

He's forsworn his own family

because everyone on
Majalis is his family.

Okay.

Um, what were you doing on that moon?

On that moon is an ancient retreat

for the First Servant's studies.

Elder Gamal and I were
returning him to Majalis

when the ship att*cked us

and demanded we surrender the child.

And you have no idea who they were?

The closest inhabitable
planet is occupied by

descendants of a
long-abandoned alien colony.

Still, our two worlds have coexisted

peacefully for centuries.

I believe it is possible
they were after a ransom.

In two days, I will be overseeing

the First Servant's
ascension to the throne.

It's a sacred ceremony.

If outsiders knew about that,

they would also know
Majalis would pay anything

for the child's safe return.

LA'AN: We should send a landing party

to investigate the crashed ship.

There is a chance, however
slight, your attackers survived.

An investigation won't be necessary.

All I ask is you return
us peacefully to Majalis.

An investigation is not only
necessary, it is required.

Captain Pike.

My people didn't join the Federation.

We've always handled
things for ourselves.

Please, let us handle this.

Starfleet regulations
requires us to investigate

any vessel that att*cks us,

with or without your
cooperation, I'm afraid.

I'm sorry.

If you insist,

I'm coming, too.

With or without your cooperation.

It's showing a slight reduction
in cerebral blood flow.

Consistent with head trauma.

Next time the hull falls on you,

try not to block it with your head.

- [CHUCKLES]
- [CHUCKLES] Deal.

Do you have anything to eat?

Does this look like a mess hall?

Ah. Please keep that butcher's Kn*fe

away from the First Servant.

- It's a subdermal scalpel.
- I know what it is.

All I needed was for you
to scan him, that's all.

May I?

It's okay, Nurse.

Have at it.

There. Just wanted to check that

his quantum-bio
implants are functioning.

Thank you.

He has quantum-bio implants?

They didn't show up on my scan.

GAMAL: That's not
surprising, considering

the state of this abattoir.

This is a state-of-the-art
medical facility.

GAMAL: Maybe to you.

In my clinic, healing
begins at a subatomic level.

FIRST SERVANT: It's
true. My implants rebuild

biological functions
using quantum mechanics.

What is that?

Back up. You're a doctor.

I was,

until I became the father
of the First Servant.

- Now he's my only patient.
- This scanner is rudimentary,

but still pretty interesting.

- He's improving.
- GAMAL: I'd still like

to keep him here for observation.

So, in theory,

your implants might
re-align peptide bonds

within any degraded protein?

At the bare minimum.

M'BENGA: If this is true, disease

and suffering would
be things of the past.

On Majalis, we have a saying.

"Let the tree that grows
from the roots of sacrifice

lift us where suffering cannot reach."

We have no disease of any kind.

Life signs?

No readings.

Nothing's in here.

LA'AN: Let's sweep the area.

Be alert for any
surprises they left behind.

Congratulations. You just flunked

lesson three of security.

"Let your tricorder
do the investigating."

Some Klingon ships are equipped

with a scuttle system,
even the lightest touch

could trigger an auto-destruct sequence.

I don't think we're in
any danger of blowing up.

They wiped their data banks.

Luck runs out fast, Cadet.

Next time, be more careful.

Crash site is secure, Lieutenant Spock.

Looks like they beamed out.

The technology here is consistent

with the colony I told you about.

This does not appear to be a
part of the ship's functions.

Do you recognize it?

No.

But I recognize this.

PIKE: What am I looking at?

An oath coin.

Linnarean Guards are
given one when they swear

to protect the life
of the First Servant.

It's the highest of our m*llitary honors.

Look.

To deface a sacred symbol,

it's forbidden.

I have to entertain the possibility

that one of our guards
has betrayed his oath

and joined forces with the alien

colonists in trying to
kidnap the First Servant.

The boy is in great danger.

Frankly, so am I.

You can all stay on the Enterprise

for as long as you need.

I have duties on Majalis.

Peaceful transition of power,

it's the cornerstone of our society.

Any disruption now would
create widespread panic.

Then I'll send you with armed escorts.

We're a private people.

Foreign representatives aren't welcome.

What about a friend?

You can have friends, right?

After your speech at
the opening ceremony,

you have the tree-planting
at the sky garden,

and then you have the Festival
of Gratitude all evening.

That's quite a schedule.

See why I couldn't stay away?

I need to add something to the agenda.

Please bring in the guards.

Ready to shake the tree
and see what falls out?

Am I.

Here we go.

Elder Gamal,

a word in private?

Do you recognize this?

No.

My analysis indicates it is
a kind of neural dampener,

designed to reduce the
brain's electrical activity.

We found it in the wreckage of the ship.

GAMAL: As I said, I've never seen this.

SPOCK: Based on its size,

logic suggests your
attackers may have intended

to use it on the boy.

Can I see it?

I'd rather you didn't.

You must be the science officer.

- I am.
- Do you know the speed of propagation of subspace

radio signals in
long-range communications?

I believe it is roughly , times

- the speed of light.
- Really?

Wow, that's... super slow.

No wonder you have to
use subspace relays.

At those distances, the
signals would degrade

long before they were received,

even when radially polarized.

I do not know many your age
who grasp radial polarization.

I'm interested in it because

I thought it would be fun to
have a friend across the galaxy.

I once worked on my
own subspace frequency.

I bet I could generate one
by rewiring this biobed.

That would be an impressive feat,

though Dr. M'Benga might object.

Pardon me, Mr. Spock.

The boy needs his rest.

He has a big day tomorrow.

If you don't mind.

ALORA: It is the eve
of the First Servant's

ascension to the throne.

In our most sacred time,

it is important to remind ourselves

of the sanctity of our calling,

so I ask that you renew your vows.

Present your coins.

Will you uphold your covenant to Majalis

and faithfully defend the
life of the First Servant?

You hold your oath,

your bond,

in your hand.

Kier, the case is damaged.

Your coin... what happened?

It's nothing. An accident.

May I take a closer look?

No.

This way.

FEMALE GUARD: Spread out!

[GRUNTS]

[SHOUTS]

[GRUNTING]

[GRUNTS]

It's not on stun.

Kier,

we just want to talk.

Good.

Now, tell me,

why were you on that ship?

To fulfill my oath,

and to renounce everything
this floating hell stands for.

Long live the First Servant.

[GRUNTING]

[BOTH PANTING]

[SHOUTS]

Careful, Cadet. Remember to chew.

Oh, right, you're on rotation
with Lieutenant Noonien-Singh.

Word gets around.

Tell her from me, you
deserve a full hour.

You can tell me yourself, Lieutenant.

I would, but

I'm, uh, conflict-averse.

[UHURA CHUCKLES]

LA'AN: Take a look at these data chips.

Are these from the crash site?

I may have liberated them.

But isn't taking them without
permission against protocol?

Lesson six of security:

"Know when to bend the rules."

You're right.

Starfleet wouldn't approve
of how I acquired these,

so I can't put them through
the ship's translator.

Fortunately for me, I don't have to.

Following proper
procedure would take weeks.

You want me to translate all of these?

Well, you're a linguist, aren't you?

I see no signs there
was ever any head trauma.

To reconstitute the molecular
structure of damaged tissue...

[SHORT EXHALE]

It's revolutionary.

May I ask a hypothetical,

doctor to doctor?

No one's stopping you.

Say I had a patient with
mast cell cygnokemia.

-year-old female.

Could quantum-bio implants

reverse cellular degranulation,
even in late stages?

On Majalis, it could be reversed.

And if I ever had such a patient,

could I send them your way?

I'm afraid not.

It is illegal to share our
technologies with unaffiliated races.

The Federation has similar policies.

Not when it comes to
medical interventions.

Perhaps, one day,

an alliance between our
worlds could serve us all.

Sure you don't want to get
checked out by a doctor?

I'm okay, Chris, really.

I just...

I knew him. Kier.

- For years.
- He would've k*lled you.

- He almost did.
- That's exactly it.

I mean, what if there are others

who feel the same way he did?

That I thought I knew.

I feel like there's no one I can trust.

I'm gonna put a guard
out here, just to be safe.

You don't have to do that.

I didn't save you from a pulsar
just to let you get k*lled.

I meant...

you could come in with me instead.

[PIKE AND ALORA LAUGHING]

PIKE: I have a confession to make.

That first time we met...

I may have been hitting on you,

- just a little.
- [CHUCKLES]

Oh, you definitely were.

[LAUGHS]

Got to admit...

it's pretty crazy we met again.

It does seem unlikely.

I did think about you
every now and then.

Yeah, me too.

I thought...

"I wonder what ever
happened to that Majalan girl

who couldn't fly a shuttle."

- [LAUGHS]
- Stop it.

I knew how to fly it.

Yeah. I just flew it
into the wrong place.

[LAUGHS]

I don't know, I felt like...

we recognized something in each other.

It was a shame that we never
got to follow through with that.

Was I wrong?

I mean, I wasn't expecting this.

Mm.

But it's rare to know
what's in your future.

Yeah, it is rare.

Some of us get a glimpse, though.

What do you mean?

Um...

In ten years,

there's going to be an accident.

It doesn't end well for me.

Even the best of Federation medicine

won't be able to help me.

How can you know this?

I know.

Our doctors are capable of
things that you can't imagine.

Only...

Only?

Only you'd...

have to be one of us.

To live here,

our way.

Science, service, sacrifice?

[SIGHS]

That future is still very far away.

- Sorry, I've overstepped.
- Mm, no, you didn't.

Thank you for telling me.

You'd be welcome here. It's just...

... another part of
the future to consider.

You called, Cadet?

You asked for a needle in
a haystack, and I found it.

I translated their dialect

and cross-checked it
the old-fashioned way,

and I know where they're from.

- So, you did the bare minimum I asked for.
- No.

I also parsed their dialects

and isolated the roots
of their language.

I found more than what you asked for.

A lot more.

I think we should take
this to the Captain.

- Okay. Well, let me know what he says.
- Cadet.

It's your work. You should present it.

If you're sure of
your findings, that is.

I am, sir.

Right.

[CHILDREN GIGGLING IN DISTANCE]

Rukiya?

Dad, look what he made.

Sorry, I hope you're not mad.

The grid was just made of noble gasses

I took from the atmospheric processor.

They're non-reactive, so
I figured they'd be safe.


Darling. You shouldn't be up.

Please sit.

[GRUNTS]

I was having fun.

How did you know about her?

You and the Elder talk loud,

and when I couldn't find anyone
with cygnokemia in sickbay,

I checked the places I'd try to hide in.

Do I have to go back in?

Yes.

But maybe not for much longer.

Goodbye, Rukiya.

I didn't mean to get you in trouble.

You can't tell anyone about her.

Why not?

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

I heard some noises. What's going on?

I was just looking for a midnight snack.

GAMAL: Seems more like
you were showing off.

Come on. We're going.

I beamed up. Someone
want to explain to me

why I had to hear this extremely
urgent report in person?

Some information has come to light

that we thought you
might want to discuss

without the risk of
Minister Alora overhearing.

And what could that possibly be?

Cadet Uhura?

UHURA: We matched the language
spoken by the kidnappers

to a non-Federation colony. Prospect .

That's an L-Class planet
a couple light years away.

Very barren, harsh climate.

The colony is barely
above a subsistence level.

Yes. Alora told us about them.

I suppose it makes sense.

Desperate people do desperate things.

Here's the surprising part.

This language has common roots

with the dialect spoken on Majalis.

Linguistically speaking,
it's impossible.

This colony isn't alien, Captain.

It has to be an sh**t off Majalis.

At the end of the day,
we have to ask ourselves:

why would anyone leave
paradise for Prospect ?

- There has to be a reason.
- And if the colony is connected to Majalis,

why would Elder Gamal and
Minister Alora tell us otherwise?

Majalans aren't trusting of outsiders.

That's how Alora and I
met. Her shuttle failed.

It led to an invitation
to join the Federation.

If that accident had never happened,

I'm not sure our two
peoples would have ever met.

- There must be a reasonable explanation for this.
- [COMM CHIMES]

M'Benga to Bridge.

Elder Gamal just walked
out with the First Servant.

I couldn't stop them.
They said they were

going back to the planet.

GAMAL: Captain, good.
Tell your Transporter Chief

that we need to return
to the surface now.

PIKE: We agreed that the
First Servant was safer here.

If I could ask you to step down.

With due respect, I
don't believe you're truly

capable of keeping him safe here.

Who told you you could beam them down?

No, it wasn't me, Captain.

Someone else must have
locked onto their signals

- while our shields were down.
- What the hell is going on?

See if you can get them back.

Pike to Bridge. Number One, I
need you to scan for nearby ships.

UNA: Reading one, Captain.

A combat cruiser attempting to flee.

Where is the First Servant?

- Red alert.
- [ALARM BLARING]

[BOATSWAIN'S WHISTLE BLOWS]

Status.

SPOCK: Sensors pick up the
First Servant's life signs

on the combat cruiser.

Their deflector shields prevent
us from beaming him back.

- Have we tried hailing them?
- Several times.

- They're ignoring us.
- I'll remind them we're bigger.

Mitchell, deploy a tractor beam.

We can't let them go to warp.

Targeting and deploying now, sir.

Sir, they're going to warp anyway.

They really want to
play tug-of-w*r with us?

The stress is creating a
catastrophic strain imbalance.

I have to increase our
structural integrity field.

If they still try to go to warp,

it could destroy the cruiser.

We can't risk harming them. Disengage.

Now, Mitchell.

How could this happen, Chris?

- You said he was safe.
- It's an unimaginable loss.

If the Federation can
be of any assistance

guiding your people through it...

There's nothing to guide us through.

It means our world is over.

Alora, it's a tragedy,

and I understand the
symbolic significance, but...

You don't understand.

If the First Servant doesn't ascend,

Majalis will fall out of the sky.

The surface of our planet
is nothing but rivers of lava

and lakes of acid. We'll be destroyed.

How can any of that rest
on the fate of one child?

Damn it.

Can someone tell me how the hell

that combat cruiser managed
to beam someone off my ship?

UHURA: I think I can,

Captain.

The girl is deluded.

I'm not.

She is just summarizing facts

and drawing the logical conclusion.

Isn't that right, Uhura?

Yes, sir. Thank you.

Walk me through it, Cadet.

To beam someone off the Enterprise

without us knowing about
it, you'd have to lock on

to that signal really fast.

Which means you'd need full biopatterns

like the ones we keep
on file in sickbay.

So, I checked our
records, and it turns out

Elder Gamal accessed
them right before he took

- the First Servant to the transporter room.
- GAMAL: I'm his doctor.

I'm entitled to his medical records.

UHURA: You didn't just
access his biopattern,

you did a full scan on yourself

and uploaded that, too.

LA'AN: I think my promising
young cadet just demonstrated

Lesson Seven of security on you.

Leave no stone unturned.

I usually require cadets to look under

Mugatan breathing stones for that one.

- Oh...
- LA'AN: That won't be necessary.

What aren't you telling us, Gamal?

Now's the time.

- [COMM CHIMES]
- SPOCK: Captain, can you join me on Deck ?

I have discovered something
I think you need to see.

Okay. Escort the Elder to the brig.

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

The First Servant was a rather
ingenious child, Captain.

He devised a method of generating

his own subspace channel
on an unused frequency.

I thought there might be
some utility in monitoring it.

And I assume that's why
you dragged me down here.

This is a distress signal from him.

[BEEPING]

How?

No one on that combat
cruiser could have survived.

Perhaps he was never
on that combat cruiser.

I believe his kidnappers transported him

to where the signal originates:

- here, on Enterprise.
- [BEEPING SPEEDS UP]

To be precise...

... right here, Captain.

It's all right. You're safe now.

Okay? Come with me.

Let's get him to sickbay.

I need to get to the ascension.

There will be plenty
of time for all that.

No, it's starting now. Majalis needs me.

Okay.

Captain to Bridge.

Open a channel to Majalis
and tell Minister Alora

I've got some news she'll want to hear.

ALORA: As the First Servant
dedicates himself to Majalis,

all of Majalis dedicates itself to him.

It's, uh, it's beautiful.

It wouldn't have happened
without you, Chris.

You saved us.

You-you still haven't explained
how the fate of your planet

could rest on the head of this child.

It's complicated. Sacrosanct.

Or why Elder Gamal
would kidnap his own son

and put the fate of his planet at risk.

- I can't speak to the motives of one...
- Or why you

failed to mention that
the kidnapping plot

started on a colony of your people:

Prospect .

We begin the procession.

Rejoice.

I shouldn't be in here. I'm
not a Federation citizen.

I've done nothing wrong.

You tampered with the
Enterprise'stransporter,

using it to illegally transport a minor,

whom you then hid on our ship.

A violation of multiple Federation laws.

I took my own child for his safety.

Is that why your associates
had a neural dampening device?

- For his safety?
- Yes.

Its purpose

is to make him unable to fulfil
his duties as the First Servant.

I want to talk to Captain Pike.

Captain Pike is on Majalis
with the First Servant,

so I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

You returned him?

Mm.

- So the ceremony has g*n?
- By now,

- presumably, yes.
- I was wrong.

I deserve to be in here,
Commander, I know that.

I didn't just...

violate the law of my planet,

I violated my own principles.

Serving Majalis is his destiny.

His reason for being.

Without him, Majalis could not be.

You plugged a kid into a machine.

What's it gonna do to him?

We don't know.

The machine needs the neural
network of a child to function.

Our founders designed it
that way. We don't know why.

We've hunted for centuries for
alternatives and found nothing.

It was the purpose of
my research when we met.

Will he suffer?

Yes.

We don't pretend otherwise.

We live in gratitude for him.

And when a new First Servant
ascends, we will live for her.

Your whole civilization...

All your... This.

It's all founded

on the suffering of a child.

Can you honestly say
that no child suffers

for the benefit of your Federation?

That no child lives in poverty

or squalor,

while those who enjoy
abundance look away?

The only difference
is we don't look away.

And because of that,
the suffering is borne

on the back of only one.

That's what makes it a sacred honor.

That's why I choose our way.

No.

The first chance I get...

... I'm reporting this to Starfleet.

And what?

We're not a Federation world.
You have no jurisdiction.

Maybe, in the future,

you'll feel differently.

- Now, Number One.

Doctor, a word.

Sorry for the interruption.

It's fine.

I'm told you've requested
transit to Prospect .

I used to think they
were a planet of traitors

committed to destroying our way of life.

And now?

They tried to help me save my child,

and I failed.

But maybe I could...

... help them save the next one.

I wish you luck.

And I you, Doctor.

Which is why I'm here.

That hypothetical
patient with cygnokemia...

her case stuck with me.

I thought perhaps if I could
take a look at the file,

I could walk you through the
theory behind the treatment.

It's not a cure, but...

But it could be the first step to one.
