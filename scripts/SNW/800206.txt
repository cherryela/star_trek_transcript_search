Strange New Worlds...

HEMMER: My sacrifice will save
the lives of those I care most about.

- It's time for me to go.
- SPOCK: I've let something out.

- CHAPEL: It's your emotions.
- SPOCK: I can't control it.

Mr. Kirk, clean your mess.

T'Pring and I have
decided to take time apart.

I am conflicted because I
have feelings for someone else.

I don't want to suppress
this one any longer.

YMALAY: Those events were
never supposed to happen

and you were never meant
to be aware of them.

I have to insist that you not share

any of what you
experienced from this time.

Buy me a drink next time
we're on starbase together.

That, uh, sounds lovely.

UHURA: The people you love the
most can cause you the most pain,

but it's the people you
love that can mend your heart

when you feel broken.

UHURA: Communications
Officer's Log, stardate . .

Enterprise has been
sent to Bannon's Nebula,

on the edge of explored space.

I've seen a lot of nebulas,
but this one's special.

It's a stellar nursery,
the birthplace of new stars.

But that's not why we're here.

The nursery is also full of
deuterium... starship fuel.

Starfleet's building an outpost
here to collect and refine it,

if they can ever get it working.

PIKE: Amazing to think that
a million years from now,

those brand-new stars will shine
down on explorers just like us,

but this place will look
entirely different by then.

Uhura. You awake there, Ensign?

My eyes are technically open, Captain.

Just didn't get much sleep last night.

Or the last ten.

Oh. Well, I appreciate all
the work you've put into

coordinating this mission,

but you generally only want
to burn the candle at one end.

- I'll take that under advisement.
- [EARPIECE CHIRPS]

The crew of the refinery
sends their greetings

and they're waiting for
our engineering details.

Have Chief Kyle stand
by to initiate transport.

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

I hear congratulations are
in order, Fleet Captain.

- Stop it.
- Fleet Captain?

I've been given command of
the refinery and the Farragut,

just until we get the station on line.

Well, it's the shiniest
gas station I've ever seen.

Well, it's not just a
gas station, Lieutenant.

It's right at the edge of the frontier.
It unlocks half the quadrant.

It'll be the jumping-off point
for the next great age of exploration.

Oh, good, I was afraid
I'd miss the speech.

Well, I started earlier
but Uhura fell asleep.

I assumed Starfleet's primary motivation

was the nebula's
proximity to Gorn space.

Sadly, you're probably right.

Their presence is growing.
This will help us counter it.

Which is why the refinery
needs to be finished

- as soon as possible.
- SPOCK: While the refinery is off-line,

Enterprise's collectors are operational,

though the process may be slower.

It would be logical to use this
opportunity to refuel ourselves.

My thoughts exactly, Mr. Spock.

Ortegas, find us a dense pocket
of deuterium and do some laps.

Rip some doughnuts through
the gas cloud, aye, sir.

Nice and slow, we don't want to
use more fuel than we collect.

Activating Bussard collectors.

- Refueling underway, Captain.
- [CHIRPS]

- [DRONING SIGNAL]
- [CHATTER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]

Sorry to interrupt, Captain.
I'm receiving a signal.

On speakers.

Any time, Ensign.

Uh...

- It's gone.
- Can you play back the recording?

I can't find it, sir.

It was there, Captain.

- It's probably just a glitch...
- I'll run a full diagnostic

on the communication system.

HEMMER [ON VIDEO]: First,
disable the subspace antenna.

Check for a charge on the EPS manifold

before disconnecting this tap.

Perfect.

- Now, if there's any residual ionization...
- [DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

- ... here is where you'll find it.
- Uh, what the hell

- are you doing inside my nacelle?
- Sorry.

I am recalibrating the
communications array.

The antenna assembly
goes through the nacelles.

I like to be thorough,
and I've asked for so many

of these recalibrations that
eventually Hemmer got annoyed

and said it would be easier
to show me how to do it myself.

You know, "teach a cadet to fish."

So we made a recording.

Hemmer was our chief
engineer, before he...

I know. He was one of my best students.

I'm sorry, I just said
that because he's dead.

Actually, he was just okay.

But look... look what
he made of himself.

[CHUCKLES] Right.

Anyway, I'm almost done.

How come you never talked to me before?

Uh, I'm... I'm sure I have.

Oh, no.

- No, no.
- Oh.

I'm sorry.

I've just been busy, I guess.

Welcome to the Enterprise.

HEMMER: ... here is
where you'll find it.

Now, what do you do next?

I don't know.

[SHORT CHUCKLE] I won't let
you blow up the ship, I promise.

- Not that!
- [GASPS]

[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

- Important lesson: be less gullible.
- Hey!

HEMMER: Back to work.

Let's start by turning down the
gain on the subspace antenna...

PIKE: Between us and the bulkhead,

the whole project's been a fiasco.

The refinery was supposed
to be on line two months ago.

What's slowing it down?

"Organizational difficulties"

was the polite term that Starfleet used.

Their previous superintendent
got shipped back to Earth,

which is why they could
really use your version of...

managerial fervor?

Mm! Nothing beats cleaning
up somebody else's mess.

PIKE: Space.

The final frontier.

♪

♪

Based on what you heard and saw,

and the elevated readings
from your visual cortex,

I'd say it's pretty clear
you were hallucinating.

You said you had just
watched a video of Hemmer.

His death was fresh in your mind.

Starfleet officers aren't
supposed to randomly hallucinate.

You didn't do anything wrong.

And there was nothing random about it.

While working in the
nacelle you were exposed

to a small amount of refined deuterium,

which can be dangerous.

You have a mild case
of deuterium poisoning.

And that can cause
terrifying hallucinations?

It can.

You could also experience headaches,
blurred vision, nausea.

This should help with the symptoms.

[GRUNTS SOFTLY]

But there is something else here.

Your serotonin and cortisol levels.

You haven't been sleeping.

Oh.

It's been a busy...

year.

Exhaustion can exacerbate
the effects of deuterium poisoning.

You need to rest.

How am I supposed to sleep
after what I just saw?

I empathize.

But I also know a stubborn
patient when I see one.

You aren't going back on duty
until I'm satisfied you've slept.

Head to Deck Seven,

get to work stabilizing
the life-support grid.

Aye, sir.

It's not as bad as it looks.

It's way worse.

The central refining and storage systems

all seem to be in good shape.

Have you looked at the maintenance logs?

Because you get the feeling
that this place has been

breaking down a lot faster

than the crew is able to fix it.

Luckily, we have three crews now.

Enterprise and Farragut's teams
can mop up the problem systems

while the station's teams
get the refinery running.

Yes. But if there is
an underlying issue,

and it smells like there is,

we ought to figure that out.

I typically don't
base my decision-making

off of feelings and smells.

Oh. [CHUCKLES]

Any underlying issues will
become clear as we work.

Mm. Aye aye, Commander.

So, what's new and exciting

in the world of xenoanthropology?

Literally everything in
xenoanthropology is new and exciting.

But instead of giving you

a long answer you don't
actually care about,

why don't we skip to your news?

Wow.

Sensing some hostility there, Sam.

Not at all.

Congrats, Jim. First
officer of the Farragut.

Well, not for another few months.

I still have to train my replacement.

Still, it's quite an achievement.

- Thank you.
- And youngest first officer in the whole fleet.

Youngest first officer ever, actually.

I don't suppose you remember
who held the record before you?

Ah, okay. That's what this is.

It was George Kirk, Sr.
First officer of the Kelvin.

Dad gave you his first name,

even if you choose not to use it,

so I have to do something to keep up.

You're making me look...

Like what?

Sam, what does my ambition
have to do with you?

Dad has a very old-fashioned idea

of what a successful career looks like,

what a fulfilling life looks like,

and it just so happens
it looks a lot like you.

Well, if you're so worried
about impressing Dad,

then why are you
wallowing in a science lab?

Wallowing, seriously?

Records are made to be broken.

I put in some legwork to
b*at this one. So what?

We can make the old man
proud in our own ways.

Or not at all.

[SIGHS]

Finally! Okay,

life support's been stabilized.

Are you kidding me?

We need to send a team to Deck Five

to get the EPS regulators back on line.

Yes. Well, that is
going to have to wait.

One of my teams found something
in the fuel distribution system.

That system was on line
already. What were you...

- [SIGHS]
- You disobeyed my direct orders

and went digging around in
the functioning systems...

If I had followed your
orders to the letter,

we would never have found
evidence of sabotage.

Sabotage?

SPOCK: Your move.

I know.

Is that not a polite euphemism
for "make your move faster"?

Am I boring you, Mr. Spock?

Decidedly not.

Your move.

There is a matter I've
been meaning to discuss.

Should I get a drink first?

You sound serious.

Starfleet is built on
a command hierarchy.

Fraternization can lead
to... complications.

- As such, there are protocols...
- You want to tell Starfleet about us.

If there is anything to tell.

Your move.

Relationships...

at least for humans, can be...

quantum things.

Think about Schroödinger's cat...

they exist or

they don't,

- depending on who's observing them.
- That is...

Not how quantum
superposition actually works?

[CHUCKLES]: Yeah, I know.

It's a-a metaphor, Spock.

A messy one. Just like

whatever this is.

My point is

if we let Starfleet...

or anyone else, for that matter...

look inside the box, then...

Our quantum cat

might disappear.

I'd just as soon let it live,

see how big it grows.

- Your move.
- UHURA: Excuse me.

- Ensign, aren't you...
- Supposed to be resting, sir, yes, but...

Everybody ignores the "orders"
part of doctor's orders.

I don't have deuterium poisoning.

When I saw Hemmer on the turbolift,

I heard the same sound
that I heard on the bridge,

but I heard it on the bridge
before I went into the nacelle,

before I was exposed to deuterium.

You believe your hallucinations
began on the bridge.

Logic would suggest that

the simplest solution is often

the correct one, right?

You seem to be the only
Enterprise crewmember affected.

Scans show nothing in the sector
that would explain your symptoms.

Logic would suggest exposure
to a known hallucinogen

is a more likely source
of hallucinations than...

Than nothing at all.

CHAPEL: Yeah, I looked
at your chart, Nyota.

It's... You have a textbook case

of overwork and exhaustion.

I can prescribe you
something to help you sleep.

Sleeping is the last thing
I want to do right now.

Saurian brandy.

Coming right up.

Your, uh, Vulcan buddy
should protect his queen.

He was two moves away from checkmate

it's a little bit
fringe, but hear me out...

that extra-dimensional life-forms

could actually poke into our space

That's how the universal

Maybe my brain is doing the same thing?

Invisible aliens are using your

we're responsible.

They showed me the ship exploding

because they are desperate
to break free, but...

We're k*lling them.

We're k*lling the ones they love,
and they're terrified.

And that's what they're making me feel.

If they're living in the
nebula, in the deuterium...

In a way, they are the deuterium.

So, then when we pull the deuterium

out of the nebula into our nacelles,

and when the station
processes and refines it...

We're basically torturing them.

Uhura to Captain Pike.

Sir, we need to stop the fuel
refinery from being activated.

PIKE: I'm not sure what's going
on, Ensign, but it's too late.

The refinery was
activated five minutes ago.

Captain, you have to
shut down the station!

It's a matter of life or death!

PIKE: I'll contact
Una and do what I can.

Nothing's working.

The refinery's automated
systems aren't responding

to any commands. It's not shutting down.

Perhaps Lieutenant Ramon

did more damage than we thought.

Bridge.

[DRONING SIGNAL]

[METAL CREAKING]

Keep going.

[DRONING SIGNAL CONTINUES]

[DRONING STOPS]

[DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT]

You all right?

The station's emergency shutdown
procedures aren't working.

You mind telling me why we need
to shut it down in the first place?

We believe there's some
sort of alien life-form...

We're k*lling them, Captain.

The creatures that live in
the deuterium in the nebula...

we're k*lling them

by pulling them into our
fuel pods and our nacelles,

and now the station's
doing the same thing,

but at a much larger scale.

But we can't see them or
detect them in any way.

I can hear them.

So could Ramon.

They're screaming for our help.

Ramon d*ed trying to save them.

Captain, you told me
the point of this station

was to help us find new forms of life.

But what is the point of exploring

if we're just gonna k*ll what we find?

We can't shut it down.

Then we need to destroy it.

How certain are you?

I'm certain, Captain.

What's the play?

Hail the refinery,

order an emergency evacuation,

then vent all the deuterium
from Enterprise's fuel pods.

Order the Farragut to do the same.

You heard her.

FEMALE: Aye, sir.

Attention. All refinery
crew and maintenance teams,

evacuate immediately. Repeat: all...

No life signs aboard.

All crew have safely
cleared the refinery.

Fire torpedoes!

Torpedoes away.

Did that work?

Uhura, what is it?

We did it.

They're safe.

ORTEGAS: That's it?

UHURA: Yeah.

That's it.

The jumping-off point for
a new era of exploration.

Well...

Starfleet can build a new
gas station someplace else.

One where there isn't anything
living in the deuterium.

And if there's any blowback, it's on me.

End of the day, that was my call. Okay?

Or we can tell 'em someone's
brash influence rubbed off on you.

Always happy to be of service.

You know, I was thinking,

you discovered a
completely new form of life.

They might give you a medal.

And now, if you don't mind,

would you take your station.

Hail the Farragut.

As soon as we've collected
all of our escape pods,

let's get out of this nebula
before we cause any more damage.

And then I am going
to need Admiral Nagawa

on my private channel. And after that,

go take a nap.

That's an order.

Starship Maintenance .

Starship Maintenance, what about it?

You were my professor at the Academy.

Oh, I remember.

You gave me a C.

And you deserved that C.

My final paper was
meticulously researched.

It was sloppy.

But for what it's worth,
that well-deserved C

is absolutely not what's
been bothering you.

It's Hemmer.

I'm a reminder that your
friend d*ed and I replaced him.

And every time you see me,

it dredges up all of that sadness.

I get it.

I've been there.

Too many times.

And if you want to
keep saying it's the C,

I don't have to contradict you.

Why do you think they chose me?

You were exactly what they needed.

Thoughtful, empathetic.

You heard them.

I mean, maybe all it

Well, I'm glad to see that
everything worked out for the best.

And I think I'm gonna write a

I've been wanting to say...

the Farragut is lucky to have you, Jim.

I'm proud of you. Honestly.

Thanks, Sam.

What is happening right now?

I'm not sure, either.

You're seriously not gonna apologize?

For what... for being
