ORTEGA: You do not want to be
late to the captain's table.

Captain wants, you know, regular people,

to hear what's actually
happening on the ship.

- You ready for this?
- I am more than capable

of managing any pain you can induce.

[CHUCKLING]: Mr. Spock.

Now you're just toying with me.

- That was not my intention.
- I've noticed.

Your time in Starfleet
may be causing you

to behave in a manner so human,

we may ultimately find
ourselves incompatible.

Maybe T'Pring just feels misunderstood.

Thank you for your advice.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

T'PRING: Personal log, stardate . .

My last few weeks of service
at the Ankeshtan K'til Retreat

have been productive.

It is difficult to guide those

who once walked a destructive
path back to civilized society.

Helping them purge the emotions

that lead to thievery,
abuse, even m*rder.

Most challenging has been stealing time

for Spock and myself.

We are making the most of
our long-distance endeavor,

but I sense in Spock a desire
to explore his human side.

So I've been attempting to
introduce experimentation

into our relationship
in an effort to...

as humans are apparently
fond of saying...

"spice things up."

I have been doing research on human sex.

[STIFLED COUGH]

- What?
- InTropic of Cancer,

the human author, Henry
Miller, has a very specific idea

about sexuality, which
strikes me as very male.

- I... have not read it.
- Meanwhile,

Erica Jong's Fear of Flying
presents a female point of view,

while still tied to a
th-century conception of...

I am not familiar
with that book, either.

Mm. Well,

I found The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson

to be more interesting,

as a study of the transformations

some humans go through
in the process of...

T'Pring.

Perhaps we should read some
of these texts together.

As you wish.

But as you are half-human,

I thought the onus was
on me... as full Vulcan...

to better understand the
culture that makes you you.

Ah.

Thank you, T'Pring.

That is thoughtful.

Of course, there is no replacement

for seeing each other in person.

Have you met Dr. Aspen yet?

They seem very sharp.

Hmm.

Has razor blades for palms.

You know, to shave?

Curious.

Earth to Spock.

I am sorry.

I am distracted.

Also, a master of understatement.

I am experiencing
challenges with T'Pring.

The last time I gave
you relationship advice,

- you kind of went overboard.
- I promise not to do so again.

I need... a friend.

Ah, spill it.

T'Pring has been researching...

human sexuality.

She has been quite thorough.

That doesn't sound so bad.

One would imagine.

But?

She appears more eager to explore my...

"humanity" than I am.

Spock, are you telling me your
girlfriend is moving too fast for you?

Reconciling my divergent
cultures of origin is complex.

- The journey is challenging.
- Spock, do you know

why it's fun to be friends with Vulcans?

Because Vulcans are honest.

Don't try to be smarter than the truth.

That's what got you
in trouble last time.

Thank you.

Also, pro tip...

... pay better attention
to me when I'm talking...

... because?

You are very charming, and
I am completely missing it?

Progress.

You're learning.

I've been running aid missions
in this sector for years,

Captain, and the colonists
we're trying to help

are as desperate as any I've ever seen.

They've been stranded

on the edge of non-Federation
space for months.

When did the colonial
ships lose power, Dr. Aspen?

days ago.

They're toughing it out,

but malnourishment and
dehydration are setting in.

And, being where they are,
they're a long way from help.

My guess is we'll have our new friends

back on their feet in no time.

Thank you.

This means everything to me.

To them.

I see why Starfleet
calls you their Boy Scout.

[CHUCKLES] They do not call me that.

Chris, it's actually in your file.

PIKE: What?

But I'm not... Uh, come
on, I'm not the Boy Scout.

It's actually been really difficult

getting people out here.

Starfleet doesn't relish
their ships getting this close

- to non-Federation space.
- Well,

this sector is the quadrant's
version of the Wild, Wild West.

- So, risk assessment?
- UNA: There are reports

of an unaffiliated vessel
called the Serene Squall

carrying out raids along the border.

- Unaffiliated?
- ASPEN: Pirates.

Fun.

My organization has lost

several aid missions to that ship.

The Enterprisewould doubtless
prove superior to any pirate vessel.

These pirates are outsiders,

fiercely loyal to each other.

That bond can be more
powerful than any w*apon.

It's best to steer clear.

Your file says that you used to
serve as counselor on Starbase .

Why the switch to humanitarian work?

My experience on the border showed me

that not everyone who needs help

is lucky enough to be in the Federation.

So I decided to leave to
run aid missions myself.

That's a shame.

Starfleet could use more
people with your perspective.

LA'AN [OVER COMM]: Captain,
we're at the coordinates

of the damaged colonial ships.

I think you'll want to see this.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

- PIKE: What am I looking at?
- LA'AN: Debris.

It's all that remains of the colonists.

Ship signatures match two of
the three colonial vessels.

PIKE: Any survivors?

No life signs, sir.

Maybe they escaped to the third ship.

Is there any sign of it?

SPOCK: None, Counselor.

But I am detecting an
unidentified warp signature.

Your pirates?

The people in these ships
didn't have food or supplies...

nothing worth stealing.

LA'AN: Unless they wanted
the colonists themselves.

Outside of the Federation,
sl*very is upsettingly common.

If you're right, and I hope you're not,

then they're already
back across the border.

Sir, entering non-Federation space

requires Starfleet approval.

How long for a request
to reach Starfleet?

At this distance, two days.

This sector is too far from
Federation subspace relays

to provide rapid communication.

To put it simply, if we head
in, we would be on our own.

Send the request, Mr. Spock.

Ortegas, set a course.

We'll drop subspace buoys
as we go to maintain comms.

Those buoys will be our only
connection to civilization.

I'm aware, Mr. Spock, but
I'm not waiting to be told

it's okay to keep people
off the auction block.

We're going to find those colonists.

Oh.

It is natural the colonist's

And no small bit of guilt.

I should have gotten here sooner.

Self-blame is counterproductive

the pleasure of a Kolinahr

You are familiar with the ritual?

I've worked with Vulcans before.

Hmm?

You naturally have

I very much look forward to mine.

We picked up a distress signal
in a nearby asteroid field.

Could the colonists have
the capacity to send one,

even without their ships?

It's possible.

But I've also heard of
pirates setting ambushes

by cloning ship signals.

Exactly what I told the captain.

And I reminded Mr.

still strongly suggest that we
investigate any distress signal.

It looks like a net.

Except, you know, made of lasers.

It's formed by multiple asteroids

equipped with high-energy
electromagnetic reflectors.

Recommend we do not
cross one of the beams.

What happens if we do?

At best, it will shut down the ship.

And at worst?

- Kaboom?
- Indeed.

We should avoid the laser net.

- w*apon?
- SPOCK: Unwise.

The reflectors are likely attuned

to minute energy changes.

Shutting one off could cause

a cascade of escalating detonations.

That does not sound good.

Can we find a way to
push apart the reflectors

- to create a space to pass through?
- SPOCK: Motion would result

in timing delays, which may
trigger the same cascade effect.

Kaboom.

Sir, the net appears
to be growing smaller.

If each asteroid has a reflector,

the further we get from the source,

the more the signal should degrade, no?

Which would mean that

whichever asteroid is emitting
the highest amount of energy

is likely the source of the beams.

Isolate that one, and the
entire trap should shut down.

I'm not gonna say it.

I have been giving in to my human side.

More so than I wish to admit.

I cannot deny the emotions
within me any longer.

Spock, you are failing to
communicate effectively.

Nurse Chapel and I...

He's trying to tell you
that we're having an affair.

What?

- We're in love. I'm sorry.
- [ANGEL LAUGHING]

You're kidding, right? You
expect her to believe this?

Obviously, it's entirely a ruse

to convince you not
to make the transfer.

No. I...

♪

Oh, you guys are fun.

T'Pring, feel free to beam over here.

I feel like you could probably

straighten things out in about a minute.

T'PRING: In light of this
new information, Spock,

it is only logical that we
terminate our mating bond.

I understand.

- And I agree.
- Wait, what are you doing?

T'Pring. Parted from
me and never parted.

Never and always touching and touched.

- I sever what was.
- T'PRING: With these words, Spock,

you are freed of our bond.

I hold it broken, T'Pring.

- You know I'm still going to k*ll him.
- T'PRING: He has made his choice,

and I have made mine.

[SIGHS]

Goodbye, Spock.

Goodbye, T'Pring.

Are you kidding me?

Destroy that ship.

Powering up phasers.

[BEEPING]

Something happened.

- Uh, w*apon are immobilized.
- [WHIRRING]

- Shields just went down, too.
- What is going on?

[GRUNTS]

Incoming transmission
from the Serene Squall.

On screen.

I'm only gonna tell you this once.

Get the hell out of my chair.

UNA: Our backdoor codes

have successfully paralyzed
w*apon and defense systems.

Fire to disable impulse thrusters.

But gently.

Aye, sir.

PIKE: Hey. I...

I said gently.

What does f*ring gently even mean?

PIRATE: Impulse power is gone.

We can't get to warp, either.

The logical move would be to surrender.

I think there's more to life than logic.

And so, I suspect, do you.

For what it's worth, I did
enjoy meeting you, Mr. Spock.

Xaverius always talked about you.

I urge you to consider
that you do not need to be

either Vulcan or human.

That is and always has
been a false choice.

The question isn't

what you are.

It's who you are.

See you later.

Did we win? What happened?

Pike to Enterprise.
Everything okay over there?

Yes, Captain. The
pirates have surrendered.

We are preparing to beam
the crew back toEnterprise.

- [INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
- Oh! Uh, before you do,

any chance you could
get us out of here first?

SPOCK: Sir?

We might have taken over the
bridge a little prematurely.

Our mutiny is still in progress.

Sure would be easier to deal
with this crowd from over there.

Right away, Captain.

PIKE: Captain's log, supplemental.

Starfleet has taken theSerene Squall

and its colorful crew into custody,

although the whereabouts of
Captain Angel remain unknown.

[IMITATING PIRATE]: Argh, me mateys.

If we ever catch Angel,

we should make them
walk the plank. Argh.

Please stop.

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

- I wasn't sure you would come.
- I was in the vicinity.

I apologize for the...

incident on the bridge
between Nurse Chapel and I.

Why apologize?

It was an impressive gambit
to protect both my reputation

and my patients' safety.

- You knew?
- Of course.

I never actually believed you could
have feelings for Nurse Chapel.

Of course not.

I assumed it was part
of some greater plan.

And I was right.

I was also right about something else.

- What?
- Your human side

can be a source of strength.

There is no way you could
have sold the passion

of that kiss without it.

Thank you.

You know me well.

Perhaps we should perform

a rebonding ritual.

That seems logical.

I came here to thank you.

And to applaud your
performance on the bridge.

Yeah, well,

lying isn't your strong suit,
so I just did what I could.

We don't have to talk about it.

I thought, because you are human,

you might need to discuss your feelings.

Spock,

like I said earlier, I like Vulcans.

I know where I stand with you.

You're an honest man.

You're not the guy who would
chase after another woman

while you have a girlfriend.

So...

I know for certain...

... there's no feelings between us.

I'm glad to hear that.

You know me well.

You're a good friend, Mr. Spock.

As are you, Nurse Chapel.

Spock, one last thing.

You said that on the bridge,

you suddenly realized

the identity of the prisoner
that Angel was trying to free.

Yes. Things they say were specific

to one Vulcan in particular.

Who?

Ambassador Sarek had
a child out of wedlock.

He, although full Vulcan,

has rejected the teachings of logic.

- He's one of the V'tosh ka'tur?
- Yes.

CHAPEL: Isn't Ambassador Sarek

- your father, as well?
- SPOCK: Yes.

I believe Xaverius
to be an assumed name.

I believe the Vulcan Angel
was attempting to free

is someone I was told
to avoid at all costs...

... my half brother, Sybok.
