Last season on
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds...

PIKE: The Klingon w*r is over.
The Enterprise was on

its five-year mission.

Missing the w*r

took a toll on my crew.

I've let something out.

[ROARS] My emotions.

Rage. Pain.

I can't control it.

CHAPEL: It doesn't make you weak.

It makes you human.

LA'AN: I'd like to request

a formal leave of absence.

I found a lead on Oriana,

the girl we rescued from the Gorn.

If I said no, would it
make a difference?

I am resigning my commission.

- I'm an Illyrian.
- Rejected.

What do we do when Starfleet finds out?

You let me worry about Starfleet.

The hell is going on?

BATEL: I'm arresting
Commander Una Chin-Riley

for violations of our anti-genetic
modification directive.

I really am sorry.

So am I.

This isn't over.

PIKE: Captain's log, stardate . .

Enterprise is in spacedock
at Starbase One.

The crew is taking
some well-deserved leave

while Chief Fleet Inspector
Commander Pelia

and her team from
Operational Support Services

are running comprehensive inspections,

systems checks and upgrades.

I've had my hands full on Enterprise

getting everything ready.
But even from afar,

I sense a tension here among
the brass that I can't pin down.

The feeling that
something is in the air.

But right now I have a crisis
closer to home to deal with.

- You're not giving up.
- UNA: Chris.

Did you manage to even talk to her?

She won't respond.

She won't take my calls either.

There must be other lawyers
who can handle this.

I lied about my species

on an application to Starfleet.

Let's just say this is not a plum case.

She's the only one
who might even try to fight it.

So we go public.

- They can't ignore your record.
- No.

This is my life. I'm not
letting my mistakes ruin yours.

- Una.
- [SIGHS] Anyway...

I hear they're going
to offer me a plea deal.

You cannot resign.

The loss to Enterprise
would be unimaginable.

To me.

Don't start a fight you can't win.

You taught me that.

You didn't start this. They did.

And we're going to find a way to
win because it's what's right.

There's the Boy Scout in you again.

- I'm gonna talk to her myself, face-to-face.
- Oh, sure,

just take three days off from
being captain of the Enterprise

to go to the other side of the quadrant

and get a door slammed in your face.

Two and a half
in one of the newer shuttles.

I'll be back before Enterprise's

inspections are complete.

Chris, you're being ridiculous.

If she's your only sh*t
at fighting this,

I have to try.

Just hang in there, Number One.
That's an order. Pike out.

SPOCK: And while you

take this short leave
for personal reasons,

I will be acting captain
of the Enterprise?

PIKE: You don't sound excited, Spock.

I will remind you half our crew
is on shore leave.

And we still lack

a chief engineer
as well as a head of security.

Additionally,
Commander Chin-Riley's loss

- is acutely felt.
- Helping Una

is exactly why I have to go.

Take it easy, Mr. Spock.

You won't ever even
have to leave spacedock.

What is the human expression?
Famous last words.

Hey, I have faith in you.

See you in three days.

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

M'BENGA: Increased heart rate.
Heightened pain in the neck,

jaw and lower back.

If I didn't know better,

I'd say you were experiencing

what we humans call stress.

[SIGHS] That is... atypical.

As you know, Vulcan emotions
are stronger than human ones.

But your people control them

through suppressive cognitive blocks.

Indeed.

When you unleashed your anger
to combat the Gorn,

you removed those blocks.

Now all your emotions
are flowing more freely.

Doctor, the captain has put me
in command of the Enterprise

for the next three days.

I am concerned my emotions
may impact my judgement.

You'll just have to learn
to live with them.

Like we all do.

- I would prefer not to.
- Mr. Spock,

may I offer a more human therapy?

All Vulcans study music, yes?

For its mathematical properties.

Humans use it as a way

of channeling emotion into expression.

[PLAYING A GRACEFUL TUNE]

Lovely.

[PLAYING CONTINUES]

And your heart rate is going down.

- [DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]
- [OUT-OF-TUNE CHORD]

[PLAYING STOPS]

CHAPEL: Doctor.

Lieutenant.

Just letting you know
I'm coming on duty.

Of course. Thank you, nurse.

If you'll excuse me.

Fascinating.

Isn't that typically his line?

It's just that when he saw you, I...

Don't even.

No, no. I wouldn't.

Was there something else?

It's about that fellowship...
the archeological medicine.

I'm thinking about applying.

I'm going to have to
replace you, aren't I?

It's two months on Vulcan.

You're not getting rid of me that easy.

[MITCHELL SIGHS]

More inspectors than crew on this ship.

The pitch and yaw controls
are reversed from standard.

Standard positions aren't quick enough.

And I don't like getting sh*t,
so I adjusted them.

Highly irregular.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

Excuse me.

Oh, no, you don't.

Uh, I need to install
a secure comms patch.

- That'll reboot the system.
- And?

And we'll be off-line.
Even the emergency bands.

Figure a few hours of radio silence

would be welcome at communications.

Let me get a secondary comms on line.

No offense, but we're in spacedock.

How many hails are you getting?

[BOARD STARTS TRILLING, BEEPING]

I just need a second.

- It'll only be a few minutes.
- UHURA: And I have a job to do.

This is my station.
So if you don't mind?

Thank you.

[SIGHS]

[PLAYING A GRACEFUL TUNE]

[OUT-OF-TUNE CHORDS]

[DOOR CHIMES]

Come in.

Lieutenant. Sorry for the interruption.

Did I hear music?

What can I do for you, Ensign?

I wanted to talk to you about

an odd signal variance I picked up.

Could you not simply have called?

Internal comms are being rebooted.

It originated in the Cajitar system.

Cajitar is on the edge of Klingon space.

Yes, sir. At first,

I thought it was random signal shifting.

But I ran it through
meta-pattern analysis,

and it's a distress signal.

Who is it from?

La'An, sir.

Permission denied, Lieutenant.

But sir, if it is from
Lieutenant Noonien-Singh,

she has indicated she is
in dire need of our aid.

Well, if it is from Lieutenant
Noonien-Singh, then I remind you

that she's been on voluntary
leave from Starfleet for months.

Nevertheless, the message is dire.

It states: "Dangerous situation
on Cajitar .

Resources of Enterprise critical.

Anti-Federation thr*at".

How much do you know about Cajitar ?

It is a dilithium mining planet
on the edge of Klingon space.

A prodigious dilithium mining planet.

Since the w*r,
the colony's been governed

by a painstakingly-negotiated treaty.

We alternate our access
with the Klingons.

For the next days,
it's the Klingons' show.

We turn up during their shift,

they'll consider it an act of w*r.

There's no way we risk
a resumption of hostilities

with the Klingons over a vague message

which may or may not be from
a former member of Starfleet.

We'll check it out when we
get access to the planet back

next month. And even
if it really is your friend,

she's gonna have to
fend for herself until then.

April out.

UHURA: He's wrong. That message

has to be from La'An. She knows
our maintenance schedule.

It-it was beamed right at us.

Still, it could be a deception.

Even a trap.

The admiral was pretty definitive.

Yeah.

Our former comrade is in trouble.

She has indicated
aid to her is essential

for the safety of the Federation.

I will need your help to get
the inspectors off the ship

and achieve our objective. But

I will not ask you to do
something you believe is wrong.

If you wish to leave
or report this plan,

I will not stand in your way.

What plan?

I would have thought it obvious.

We must steal the Enterprise.

PIKE: Space.

The final frontier.

These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

Its five-year mission:

to explore strange new worlds,

to seek out new life

and new civilizations,

to boldly go where no one
has gone before.

[ALARM BLARING]

UHURA [ON P.A.]:
Attention all personnel.

We have detected a cooling leak

in the intermix chamber.
All non-essential crew members

are ordered to evacuate
the ship immediately.

[ALARM CONTINUES BLARING]

Commander Pelia. We are at red alert.

- Perhaps you did not hear the evacuation order?
- PELIA: Yes.

Never mind me. I'm just
finishing up my inspection.

SPOCK: But readings indicate a loss
of antimatter containment.

Hmm. In the same intermix
chamber that my team spent

three days evaluating, and
found nothing wrong with.

- Huh!
- SPOCK: Commander, I am alarmed at your lack of concern.

At what?

At the textbook signs
of a warp core breach?

You do know that I teach a course

in warp core breaches
at the Academy, yes?

I... didn't realize that.

Yes, well, if you had taken it,

you would know that
heightened temperatures

around the intermix chamber

is the single factor
most commonly mistaken

for an imminent breach.

Ooh, would you look at that.

Someone accidentally

simulated a coolant leak on the sensors.

If I didn't know any better, I'd say

- it was on purpose.
- SPOCK: Commander Pelia,

I am not sure what you are implying.

I'm not implying anything.

I'm flat-out saying

someone violated about

Starfleet regulations.

Well, perhaps while you're theorizing,

you might explain why

anyone would engage in such subterfuge.

Mm.

I can think of one reason.

To steal the Enterprise.

Or do you want to tell me that's

not what's happening here?

Yes, you can always count on a Vulcan's

inability to lie.

Another thing I know about Vulcans.

They don't do things
without a good reason.

Do you have a good reason
to steal the ship?

I am having what
you humans call a hunch.

A Vulcan with a hunch. That's a new one.

And not just any Vulcan.

Amanda Grayson's son.

- How do you know my...
- Well, if you're going to

steal a starship, do it correctly.

Helm, can you vent

ionized plasma from the warp nacelles?

I could, but...

should I?

- Why are you helping us?
- Oh, please.

We can spend a lot of time

talking about this or we can go.

You decide.

Vent the nacelles on my mark.

Stole the Enterprise?

SPOCK: Yes. You said it was urgent.

Wow. I would have lost so many bets.

Yeah, Vulcans can surprise you.

Thank you for coming. All of you.

What's going on?

The little girl who

survived the Gorn... Oriana.

I was trying to find her parents.

Uh, we tracked them here.

And they'd thought she was dead.

Sounds like a happy ending.

Well, up until the w*r, this planet

had provided, uh,
a steady flow of dilithium

to both sides, like it does now.

But after the w*r started,

so many ships being destroyed,

dilithium constantly
needing to be replenished,

this place became a promised land.

Ore was dug up and auctioned off

to the highest bidder
at astronomical prices.

Fortunes were minted daily
and the mining syndicate

got a piece of every single one.

Then, suddenly, peace.

A new syndicate made up of

ex-Klingon and Federation soldiers

has decided that

peace isn't good for business.

And they have one ideology:

profit.

They want to re-start the w*r.

- Restart the w*r how?
- LA'AN: All I know is

they've been looking
to get their hands on as much

Federation tech as possible.

Then, a few days ago,

there was an expl*si*n at the mine.

Half the town got sick
from ion exposure.

Including Oriana's parents.

Ion radiation is not naturally
occurring from dilithium.

But it can be created
by photon torpedoes.

That is correct.

We both served in
the Klingon w*r. Doc here just

likes to read up
on w*apon systems is all.

Yes. A hundred million
Federation bodies, slaughtered.

And for what... a parsec
of space or two?

And now some want to resume that
theater of horror for profit?

Where are, um, Oriana
and her parents now?

Med tent. They're short on
everything... doctors, supplies.

We have med kits with us.

SPOCK: See what aid you can provide.

But keep a low profile.

Ensign Uhura and I will stay to assist

- in your investigation.
- I have a rendezvous with

three potential buyers
tonight as well, so...

Wait. Ensign?

You go away, you miss things.

Seems I do.

Looking to trade at market.

I hate to bust up your plans,
but we could use your services.

Who's we?

[FEMALE SPEAKING KLINGON]

just arrived.

Three Klingons approaching.

[FEMALE CONTINUES SPEAKING KLINGON]

SPOCK: Is that Klingon
they are speaking?

I do not recognize it.

Kach-Ugh, I think.
It's a pretty obscure dialect,

but I can make out the syntax.

Were you followed?

Yes. But then I cut their throats

and they stopped following me.

Leaving bodies to find when
we don't want anyone looking.

This is the Klingon shift
on this miserable world.

Bodies pile up. Did you
bring what you promised?

I thought Klingons hated
Federation w*apon.

Why buy them?

That is not your concern.

You promised two dozen.

This is barely half that.

Well, it's what I have to sell.

I'll pay a third.

- I'm charging double.
- Double?

For half the w*apon you promised?

You don't like the questions,

you don't like the price.

And what would stop me
from just taking them

from a tiny woman like you?

This is an anti-matter

You better hope I don't let go.

Unless you're keen on losing

Double for this lot.

But I need more.

I'll see what I can do.

Well done, Lieutenant.

What's an anti-matter detonation switch?

It's not a thing, is it?

Yeah, no, definitely not a thing.

I was able to parse out some
of what they were saying,

and whatever they're planning,
it's happening tomorrow.

Should we call Starfleet?

Not until we have solid proof.

I do not relish another call
with the admiral without it.

Now let's get back
to the Enterprise and see what

Nurse Chapel and Dr. M'Benga have found.

Chief Jay.

Ready when you are.

Roger that, Mr. Spock. Small problem:

I've been tracking
the doctor and Nurse Chapel,

and we lost their signal
about an hour ago.

I'm not a cave person,
but this is for sure

the biggest I've ever seen.

Decades of dilithium mining.

How do you think they got that in here?

I think they built it.

Move. Now!

[PATIENT MOANING]

M'BENGA: Ion burns everywhere.

This level of scarring
is normally too deep to treat.

But, fortunately, your
dermal system is redundant.

You've treated Klingons before.

- Where?
- It doesn't matter.

Tell me, or I'll cut out your tongue

so you spread no more lies.

Years ago I was stationed
on the moon of J'gal.

Now I know you are lying.
If you had served

on J'gal, you'd be dead.

[DEVICE STOPS]

Do you know that after
the battle of ChaKana,

there was so much blood in the air

the rain turned red?

Ror'Queg. Are you fit for duty now?

M'BENGA: I'm done with him.

Hey. You good?

I'm fine.

You sure?

You want me to tell you this
is not bringing everything back.

I can't.

But I can tell you I'm in control.

The w*r's over, Joseph.

Yes, but how can it ever be?

I'm fine.

Have you learned anything useful?

Um, yeah. The...

... severity of the burns suggest

the photon torpedoes are on this ship.

Maybe with all the other Federation tech

they've managed to acquire.

Why?

If you have a Federation ship

in the middle
of a territorial dispute...

You could use it to att*ck the Klingons.

Start the w*r all over again.

We have to warn Enterprise.

There must be comms
somewhere here on the bridge.

So, we just waltz up there,

say, "Mind if we make a call?"

M'BENGA: You know this
can help us get there.

If it's important enough.

Do you ever not carry it?

No.

Hey.

Sure you want to do this again?

Again, no.

But I'm not seeing a better choice.

Less, if they have a grenade.

We're in space.
They can't be that stupid.

Or maybe they can.

What do we do?

Let's get those lockers open.

See if they have any EV suits.

If the Klingons see that ship,
it will start a w*r.

Indeed.

In fact, Ms. Ortegas,

I surmise that is likely
its precise intention.

I believe the Federation ship is part of

a false flag operation.

I think the extremists
intend to use the ship

to att*ck the Klingons as a way
of reigniting hostilities

with the Federation. I theorize

that Dr. M'Benga and
Nurse Chapel were indeed

taken by the extremists and were able

to reconfigure the transponder
to give us a warning.

Sir, what if Nurse Chapel
and Dr. M'Benga

are still on that ship?

They thought it worth their lives

to prevent another w*r.

Logical.

Federation ship in f*ring range.

MITCHELL: Mr. Spock,

what are your orders?

Follow the false Federation ship.

Stay in w*apon range,
but hold your fire.

And do not let the Klingons
know that we are here.

Got it.

If we don't destroy it before
we get out of the rings,

the Klingons are going

That's definitely gonna start a w*r.

I think they're cutting through.

There's a beacon in the helmet.

And an attitude jet in the pack.

So, we just jump into space
without an EV suit?

The beacon will activate
once we're in space.

I can use the attitude jet
to guide us away from the ship.

Only we'll be dead.

Not necessarily.

It'll take almost a minute
for us to freeze to death.

Don't worry.

We'll pass out after seconds.

I know it's a terrible idea.

Yeah, it's terrible.

Let's get to it, then.

Well, thank you

for getting me out of the Academy.

Are you actually Lanthanite?

Oh, a couple of drinks

and you get personal...

that it, flyboy?

I am.

I have always been
fascinated by your people.

That you managed to live
on Earth among other humans

undetected until
the nd century is remarkable.

You know your mother was one of
the first people I came out to.

I did not.

But that's a tale for another time.

And now you teach engineering
at Starfleet Academy?

Taught.

You asked me why I helped you.

You want to know the worst thing

about living almost forever?

The loss of those you love.

Oh, you sweet

un-Vulcan Vulcan.

No.

That's a pain shared

by all those who live

with even a half-open heart.

No.

It's boredom.

And on that ship of yours,

there seems to be a shortage of that.

I like it.

- Hm.
- I might even try and stick around.

Huh?

Huh?

[LAUGHS]

Another?

Please.

To the Vulcan

who acts nothing like a Vulcan.

- [LAUGHS]
- [CHEERING]

ORIANA: La'An!

Just promise you'll
stay out of trouble, okay?

I will if you will.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

Where are you gonna go now?

Um...

[ALL SHOUTING, EXCLAIMING]

After explicitly ordering you not to go,

you risked hundreds of lives,

and you risked peace in the quadrant.

If you could lower the volume
of your voice, Admiral.

Oh, my God.

Are you hungover, Spock?

The result of a peace treaty
with the Klingon captain.

- After a successful mission.
- You got lucky,

and that could have just
as easily gone the other way,

with the Federation thrown into
a brutal w*r with the Klingons.

I did what I believed was right,

followed my gut, as you humans
are so fond of saying,

and I will accept

whatever punishment
Starfleet feels is just.

Consider that Klingon hangover
your punishment.

But next time...

and there better not be a next time...

it'll be your commission.

Now, get Enterprise home.

Mr. Spock.

I didn't hear you come in.

Are you all right?

Yes.

I just...

She'll be fine.

I'm not...

I...

I have no words for what I feel.

Yes.

You let Spock off easy.

APRIL: He just kept us from potentially

having to defend two fronts
at the same time.

Even if he doesn't know it.

In any case, he's one of our best.

And if this w*r happens...

... we're gonna need
every good officer we've got.
