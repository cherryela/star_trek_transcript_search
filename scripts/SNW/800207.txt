CHAPEL: Uhura,

you have a textbook case
of overwork and exhaustion.

You haven't been sleeping.

It's been busy... Here.

YMALAY: You protected the timeline.

KIRK: This is a fork in the road.
Your future

and mine, diverging.

LA'AN: Starfleet has regulations

for situations like this.

PIKE: You're pirates.

It's an Orion specialty.

CHAPEL: Spock is my friend.

I have to tell you...

CHAPEL: It's complicated.

UHURA: Then make it simple.

CHAPEL: I wish we had more connection.

BOIMLER: Ensign's log, stardate ..

The Cerritos has just entered
the orbit of Krulmuth-B.

Home of the Krulmuth-B portal,

one of my all-time favorite portals.

We're taking routine portal
readings and making sure

the portal area is free
of any portal problems.

Stop. How are you so excited

for some random portal
nobody's ever heard of?

History buffs have.

It was discovered by Captain Pike

and the original crew of the Enterprise.

I-I mean, the second Enterprise,

- but technically...
- Uh, yeah. Okay,

it's gonna be like every other portal,
and we're just running scans.

Because it might do something.

Which it hasn't. In years.

Yeah, it's due.

Can you imagine
what it must have been like

to be with Those Old Scientists?
I mean, this is as close

as we'll get to Spock or Numero Una.

Don't call her that.
No one called her that.

Come on, we're gonna be standing
in the same spot as Uhura.

That doesn't get you a little excited?

Yeah, Uhura was cool as hell.
Probably because

she had a life outside of work.
You should try it.

Okey dokey, who's pumped to scan
some teleron radiation?

Ugh, you're excited about this, too?

Guys, a broken portal is just a tunnel.

I love scanning new things
for my collection.

Radiation's a super useful
form of energy.

BOTH: Ha-ha! Science!

Oh, the bar to excite you guys
could not be lower.

- Pretty great, huh?
- All right, let's just

get going. I can...
I'll brief you on the way.

Wait, you're in charge?

Yep. Job of a lifetime.

But you think portals are boring.

Why would they choose you?

Probably 'cause Ransom knew
it would bum me out.

Come on, sooner we leave,

sooner you get in
your all-important portal time.

[GASPS] Do you think
there'll be tachyons?

I can't wait to measure
some freaking tachyons!

Okay, the ancient inactive thingy
is right over there.

Let's go make sure
it's still not doing anything.

Hey, did you know that this portal

was actually discovered by Orions?

Oh, ho, ho, Tendi, Tendi, Tendi, Tendi.

The Enterprise actually found it.

Ooh, ah, no, an Orion
science vessel did.

My great-grandmother was on it.

But, I mean, were any Orions even

doing science stuff back then?

They weren't all pirates, you know.

Somebody had to make the starships.

Oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't
meant to suggest that...

[SIGHS] Look, all I'm saying is

wouldn't that be a
historically-appropriate career

for an Orion to have back then?

Some Orions might surprise you.

All right, Boims, I know
what Starfleet tells us

and I know you know
everything about everything,

but let's maybe listen
to Tendi on this one.

Hey, guys. You're not
gonna believe this,

but I'm picking up traces of horonium.

[GASPS] Horonium hasn't been
recorded for centuries!

Oh, I can't wait to show the guys
back in Engineering this scan.

Billups is gonna flip!

You know, Starfleet used horonium

in the original NX class.

It's lightweight, it's durable,

and it's just the right shade of gray.

Yes, yes. We were all there
for that fun time

at the Starship History Museum.

Ah, I bet Spock stood right here.

"Mr. Boimler, hand me that scanner".

- [LAUGHS] That's great!
- [SNICKERS] Is that your Spock?

Yeah, I've been working on it.

Old scientists. Old starships.

You know we're here, like, right now.

Maybe live in the moment?

I know, but... [SIGHS]

sometimes I wish
I could have lived back then.

Yeah, no, thanks. I mean, right now

when I disappoint people,
it's no big deal.

But back in the past,
I'd be disappointing Uhura.

Disappointing Uhura would be cool!

I wish I could disappoint Uhura.

No, it wouldn't.
What are you talking about?

Oh, I got to get a picture of this.

Hey Boimler, this way.
Give me a Spock pose.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. [CLEARS THROAT]

Live long and prosper.

The ancient thing is doing a thing.

Aah! Aah! Help! The portal's

Thank you so much. Oh, my God.

They never improved on these.

I mean, yeah, they got smaller
and more powerful

and arguably less likely
to explode, but design-wise?

Explode, you said?

As helpful as this analysis
of industrial design is,

why don't you tell us what you were
doing when the portal turned on?

Yeah, so I was standing, uh, about here.

And Rutherford... he's another
ensign... was scanning it

and he found some traces of horonium.

Probably from here.

BOIMLER: Anyway, we took
a holo-image with our camera

that emitted radioisotopes
which seemed to set it off.

So, I guess it was just dumb luck?

[LAUGHS]

You just, uh...

you just... laughed?

SPOCK: Yes.

The thought of assigning
intelligence to chance

Okay.

It's just, um,
I-I have reason to believe

that's a science vessel.

Do Orions have science vessels?

They're ignoring our hails.

BOIMLER: Well, it's kind of
considered offensive in my time

of Orion pirate activity in this area.

Uh, totally makes sense,

They reported several run-ins

Yeah, that is unfortunate, Captain.

Orion pirates certainly give
the rest of us a bad name.

If that's your business,

what were you doing on Krulmuth-B?

Routine surveys.

Captain, I'm reading
a transporter signal.

The Orions have beamed up the portal.

Captain Caras, care to explain?

I suspect your science officer
to be mistaken, Captain.

I'm reading an energy spike
emanating from the Orion ship.

I think I might've made
a mistake, Number One.

You? Unheard of.

Okay, I deserve that.

I shouldn't have listened to the ensign.

That's why we lost
the portal, it's just...

rare that we have someone
on the ship who's such a...

Fan? Of you, at least.

He seems completely terrified of me.

He was so excited to see me

traveler and now we have two,

Okay, not to be ungrateful,
but if you had just waited,

do you know how worried I was?

You disappeared in a vortex
while I was in charge.

For all I knew you were dead

or stuck in a dystopian San Francisco
in the middle of a riot.

Have you noticed that their references

- are weirdly specific?
- Indeed.

- ... the Bell Riots, Mariner. I was...

but we also very much need a solution.

One time traveler is a security thr*at.

- Two is...

Thought you said they were cool.

They are. This is serious.

Spock, what's going on with the portal?

Still functioning.

But without horonium
we cannot activate it.

I am afraid Ensign Mariner depleted

- the last of the supply.
- [CHUCKLES] Well, in my defense,

that thing has, like... [CLICKS TONGUE]

zero instructions, you know?

[TABLETOP SQUEAKS]

And there is no other source of horonium

anywhere in the quadrant?

None. And there hasn't been
for over a hundred years.

Can we just cook some up?

- Will you please just not?
- Sorry.

SPOCK: The ensign is correct.

We could attempt to synthesize
horonium ourselves.

Hot Spock agrees with me.

SPOCK: However, we would be
putting ourselves in great danger.

If it goes wrong, the blast
could take out half the ship.

And there is a chance
it might not work at all.

Mm, that doesn't sound very logical.

- PIKE: We need a second option.
- Will you please just stop?

- Sorry, that's what he sounds like.
- UNA: I might have one, Chris.

The ancient text on the portal.
Uhura's locked herself

in her quarters,
working on a translation.

Maybe she'll come up with some answers.

Great.

MARINER: Oh, uh, but, you know, I have

linguistics experience.
Maybe I could help her.

I really want to say no,

but how much more damage
could you do at this point?

So, go for it.

- Linguistics experience? Really?
- No,

but it's Uhura. Don't ruin this for me.

I will end your life.

Because he took an elective

in material synthesis at the Academy.

Yeah, he just doesn't know how.
Just go with it.

Mariner. Mariner!

- What?
- Why'd you do that?

Oh, okay, don't act like the
prospect of working with Spock

doesn't tick off some weird box for you.

I already worked with Spock
and it didn't...

go the way I wanted it to.

Oh, no. No, Boimler,

don't tell me you asked him
about his sehlat.

- Can you not be such a fanboy for one second?
- No, it's just...

I thought that being here
would be perfect, but...

now I just don't want to get stuck here.

- I joined Starfleet

so I could be a part of history.

But if they can't find a way
to get us back home,

we're gonna have to go
live somewhere off the grid

where we can't affect history at all.

No, no, no, I'm not living

worth admiring yet.

And there are days, like today,

where I can't even manage
a basic translation.

And, meanwhile, Erica's all like,

"You have to learn how to have fun".

But how am I supposed to have fun

when I know I have to become
this universally-known,

super-translating, unflappable,
hard-working badass?

[SIGHS]

All right, I think
it's time we took a break.

I really don't do breaks.

Yeah, I'm starting to catch that.

You know, you're the one
who could get stuck here

if we don't figure this translation out.

Are you familiar with
Starfleet labor codes?

Maybe.

Section Alpha-dash-seven:

"Officers must take meal breaks
at regular intervals".

I could report you.

- Y-You know Starfleet codes?
- Of course.

I mean, there's
a whole bunch of them that

let you slack off a ton,
so, yeah. Come on.

All right,

we got some Orion hurricanes.

Well, kind of. They actually
didn't have any Orion delaq,

so I kind of had to improvise,

which is honestly for the best.
That stuff will

mess you up, truly ruin your life.

All right.

Ah. [CLEARS THROAT]

I like you.

You're a good bad influence.

If you're still around, you should
come to Pike's surprise party.

Cool. But only if I can
take a bunch of pictures

and weird my mom out
with a history book.

[CHUCKLES]

I'm joking. Sort of.

Oh, I knew it was too good to be true.

Why is everyone obsessed
with me taking breaks? This...

this isn't the time.

[SIGHS]

On the Klingon front

you never knew when you'd get rest.

So, you'd take a break when you could

'cause you'd never get that time back.

Work will still be here in five minutes.

Fine. Fine.

Let's relax.

[SIGHS]

Ooh, easy, that's a lot of...

I've seen these.

[UHURA GRUNTS]

Wait, you-you know these symbols?

ORTEGAS: I've seen them before.

At Starbase Earhart.

A guy tried to trade me a dom-jot set.

- What's dom-jot?
- MARINER: Oh, uh,

it's this billiard game that
Nausicaans are terrible at,

yet love to bet on for some reason.

This wasn't a traditional set,
it was old.

Ancient old.

Nausicaans...

Wait, give me a second.

Erica, you're brilliant.

This is true, I am. Why?

The glyphs on the portal
are an ancient Nausicaan dialect

that's thousands of years old.

- That's why I didn't recognize it before.
- MARINER: Oh.

That's why.

Not, you know, taking five to recharge.

Unbelievable.

SPOCK: Ensign Boimler, Nurse Chapel

- told me about your exchange.
- She did?

She did not go into detail,
but it was easy to extrapolate

that there was something
you told her about my future.

- Perhaps I should know?
- Nah.

Nah, nothing from me on the old, uh...

future-altering front.

It does not take an expert
observer to recognize

that my experiments
in human emotion trouble you.

Therefore, I must surmise
that my future state...

the one you are familiar with...

must be one in which
my emotions are minimized.

Must you surmise that?

But you did say something
to Christine that upset her.

[SIGHS] Look, all I said

was that I'm surprised that you're so...

human.

Yes, the universe needs Vulcan Spock,

if everything that I know
happens... happens.

And yet I have no choice
but to stay true

to the path I have chosen in this time.

If you sway me then my future
will have been altered.

Is that not logical?

Unfortunately, it is.

Shall we activate the synthesizer?

Sure, I mean, is-is it gonna,
uh, blow my hand off?

- [GRUNTS]
- We are separating fissile isotopes at high speeds.

The chance of an expl*si*n
is down to a coin flip.

I find myself curious about chance.

Do you feel lucky?

Uh, no, not at all. I, um...

Okay. Uh, so...

[SHRIEKING]

- Okay, is that bad? Are sparks bad?
- Yes.

Seek cover.

[SHRIEKS, WHIMPERS]

Aah!

I've ruined everything.

- [SIGHS]
- PELIA: Oh, my dear,

there is nothing quite so soothing

as a properly-calibrated warp core.

You're one of those future kids.

Was. Um...

Now I'm one of those,
uh, stuck-here kids.

Also, I'm a man.

You don't happen to know about
Setlik II... did we, uh,

find more grain for the colonists there?

"More" was never on the table.
That's all anyone had.

It was specially made
to grow in their biome.

- So, now we'll just try and...
- You're relocating them.

But they've been there for generations.

There has to be
something else we can do.

Yes. Find a time travel device

and use it to stop yourself

from messing everything up!

Thank you. That's helpful.

I look up to everyone
on this ship, but...

... turns out I don't belong here.

I mean, how can I fix
everything that I...

that I screwed up?

I'm a Lanthanite.

I've lived for thousands of years.

Most heroes I've seen...

... are just pretending half the time.

Mm. There's this one guy I remember.

He said to me,

"I always pretended

to be someone I wanted to be

until finally

I became

that someone...

or he became me".

Okay, okay, um...

all right.

- Ah.
- Whoa!

- Holy Q!
- Don't!

Don't yell Q! They haven't met him yet.

They had kind of
a Trelane thing going on.

- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

Are you stealing a shuttle?

I'm not st... Oh, fudge.

What happened to your
new best friend Uhura?

Oh, Uhura's awesome.

Yeah, but the, uh,
the translation was a bust.

- Wait, she couldn't cr*ck it?
- No, she could.

Thank you. Problem is all it said was

- "This is a time portal".
- Crap.

- Yeah.
- This era's weird.

I know. Have you noticed
how slow everybody talks?

- Yeah, and quietly.
- Yeah.

So, what's with the shuttle?

Well, ever since I've got here,
all I've done

is open my big, stupid mouth
and screw everything up,

but if I want to be a hero,
I have to fix things.

Ooh, what are we fixing?

The Orions took grain in
exchange for the portal,

so I figured if we're gonna
be stuck here anyway,

might as well trade it back

and give that food
to people who really need it.

Doesn't that thing need to be
on Crumhat-D in the future?

- Krulmuth-B.
- Whatever.

And I'm... done

worrying about the future.

I want to help people now.

And the shuttle has a separate
communications array.

Easier to bypass security,
get a message to the Orions.

- All right, sneaky Boimy.
- [CHUCKLES]

I like it.

But you're not good
at breaking protocol.

You're gonna need an accomplice.

And I never get caught.

- LA'AN: What are you doing?
- Oh! Oh, no. - [SHRIEKS]

Sorry, sorry.

Hi.

You're lucky Uhura likes
to monitor local comm traffic

and was able to block
your signal. Over there.

It could have easily
escalated to a bad place.

I'm having you both confined to quarters

until we reach Starbase One.
Then you'll be their problem.

Lieutenant, I'd like a moment
alone with them both, please.

Sir.

- Mr. Boimler.
- [DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN, CLOSED]

For a guy who seems like
a rule-follower,

you certainly break a lot of them.

And Ms. Mariner.

I thought you were here
to save your friend,

not make his situation worse.

Look, it was all me, okay? I just...

I don't think Boimler can handle
getting thrown in the brig

by a guy who he dressed
up as for Halloween.

Oh, he... Really?

Yeah, he had to contour the hell
out of the jawline, too.

It-it was a process, yeah.

[CHUCKLES]

Look. [SIGHS]

I want to ask you both

for a personal favor.

Mr. Boimler.

I heard that you've been
encouraging my crew

to throw me a surprise party.

Please stop doing that.

It's just...

you never know how many
birthdays you have left,

- [QUIETLY]: What are you doing?
- and-and...

right now, you have friends
who want to celebrate you.

While you still can.

[CLICKS TONGUE] Ah.

Think I know what you're
getting at. And I already know.

- Uh, you know about...
- You... So, you know about the whole...

- What specifically do you know about?
- Not wanting a party

has nothing to do with
what's going to happen to me.

It's about

what's already happened.

What do you mean?

My father...

we didn't get along.

Frankly, there were times
I downright hated his guts.

[SCOFFS] We never resolved things.

This is the first year

I'll be older than he was when he d*ed.

But I'd give years off my own life

if we could have one more argument.

So,

my plan was to finish this mission

then sit in a fishing cabin
on Setlik II's ice moon,

bring a good bottle of whiskey
and have that talk.

I'm sorry about your dad.

But I wonder...

if, someday, you're not around anymore,

how many people on this ship

would wish they had another day
to talk to you?

Sometimes it's hard to visit the past.

- Yeah, I mean, I didn't want to be here at all.
- Shh. This...

You know...

I can understand
what it must feel like...

the both of you coming here.

I try to think how I would feel

setting foot on Archer's Enterprise.

Oh, the NX-? Don't worry,

Boimler would freak out about that, too.

The NX-.

They don't make them
like that ship anymore, huh?

No, they do.

Captain...

I think I know how to get us home.

BOIMLER: When I first arrived,
I brought expectations

of each of you from the future.

And not only was that dangerous,

it denied the reality
of who you are right now.

So, I'd like to apologize to you all

with a limerick.

UNA: Or you could just get to the point.

BOIMLER: I don't
have to do the limerick.

I don't have to...
Mariner, why don't you...

MARINER: Okay, so, one time,
Boimler dragged me

to the Starship History Museum.

Dragged? You ran up to the doors.

No, I didn't. It was boring. I hated it.

Anyway, um, so,

they had the NX- there.
Archer's Enterprise.

BOIMLER: Yeah, yeah, classic design.
Plus it had, you know,

- the grapplers.
- Skip that part. They don't care.

- I love grapplers.
- See?

- All right.
- Anyway,

later on in the tour, they said that

ships back then actually used
horonium alloy in their hulls.

Ta-da!

So we need to dig an NX class
ship out of mothballs?

No, because the tradition is

every time a new
vessel's commissioned...

Construction starts with a piece
of the last ship to bear its name.

ORTEGAS: Meaning there should be

a piece of horonium
inside the Enterprise.

- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

SPOCK: Do you know
where the section is located?

- I don't, but...
- Surprise, I paid attention.

Without being asked.

This guy was distracted
by the grapplers.

- [ORTEGAS SNORTS]
- SPOCK: It is surprising

because she normally
does not pay attention.

[UHURA SIGHS]

Oh, careful with my floor. I use that!

It is illogical to assume
that you are the only one.

One, two. I can't believe

all this time, we have been walking

over a piece of history.

I'm a huge fan of Travis Mayweather.

First pilot of the NX-.

My middle school gym
was named after him.

UHURA: Hoshi Sato was on that ship, too.

You know she spoke languages?

I wrote three papers
on her at the Academy.

[DING]

Are we sounding like...

UHURA: Them?

Indeed.

It is exhausting.

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

- [BOIMLER CHUCKLES]
- [DOOR WHOOSHES CLOSED]

Hi.

Is there a problem, Ensign?

Listen, I-I may have given you
the wrong impression

about Boimler's poster.
It-it's for recruitment.

Yeah, you're the literal

poster girl/woman for Starfleet.

- Come on, come on.
- Uh...

- You should have led with that part.
- Yeah.

- This is true?
- BOIMLER: Uh, yes, sir,

Number One, sir. Uh...

It was a really big reason why I joined.

Ad astra per aspera.

They put that on the poster?

And I put it in my bunk.

I meant for that to sound
a lot more admiring than it did.

Your flagrant disregard
for temporal protocols

by telling me this is deeply troubling.

But thanks, all the same.

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

♪ ♪

[LAUGHS]

Live long and prosper, Mr. Boimler.

[GASPS SOFTLY]

Energize.

I-I'll... You also live and...

We got your message about the portal.

That was a mistake.

That message was sent
without my authorization.

I'm afraid we still need it.

I do not like having my time wasted,

- Captain.
- It's not his fault.

- It's mine. - And mine.
- LA'AN: It's true.

It's their fault.

BOIMLER: We called you because

we didn't want those
Federation colonists to starve.

Yeah, plus we were kind of going through

a quarter-life crisis type of thing.

You know, you meet your heroes,

and then you're like, "What
have I done with my life?

- I'm trash, right?"
- You went through that, too?

Absolutely. You met Uhura.
She's the total package.

- It is intimidating.
- BOIMLER: Because I was going through the same thing

- with Spock, so...
- I know. I didn't want to... - Earlier,

you will recall, I told you that

we were here for routine surveys.

Well, here's the whole truth.

That is a time portal.

And these two are
from the future, and...

- we need the portal to get them home.
- Really?

To a future where
it's considered offensive

to assume an Orion is a pirate.

MARINER: Yeah. And, actually,
you know, one of our

best friends in Starfleet
is an Orion officer.

A scientist. Although she does also

go by the name Mistress
of the Winter Constellations.

- It's very strange.
- That name.

Her great-grandmother's on your ship.

Her name's Tendi.

I have an Astrea Tendi on my ship.

How do you know that?

- Well... Yeah.
- Because we are time travelers,

as we've been telling you.
I feel like he doesn't listen.

PIKE: How-how about this.

You let us use the portal

and as far as history is concerned,

Orions discovered it.

Orion scientists.

That's all I've ever wanted.

RUTHERFORD: There they are!
Should we go get them?

TENDI: Hang on! We'll be right there!

- Oh, no, no, no, we'll come to you.
- Just, no.

It was good to meet you, Captain.

Wha...

They seemed nice.

[SIGHS] Tendi, you were right.

It turns out Orions
did discover this portal.

I know. I told you. My great-
grandmother discovered it.

- Ooh, Astrea, right?
- That's right.

But how'd you know her name?
[SHORT CHUCKLE]

Thanks for coming back
to the T.O.S. era to get me.

You picked that up from Ransom.

Why does he always call it that?

It stands for Those Old Scientists.

- Huh. They seemed pretty young to me.
- Oh!

Numero Una.

Hottest First Officer

- in Starfleet history.
- Ow!

Hey, hey! How was the mission, Mariner?

Never seen you fight to get work before.

Captain was just gonna
send cadets to that portal,

but she called dibs.

It was boring. Go away.

You fought to get this mission?

- You did it just so I'd get to go.
- No.

Ransom's just an idiot with a bad memory

'cause he sleeps facedown
like a baby. Shut up.

Huh.

When we shouted "Surprise!"
you didn't seem very surprised.

Come on, Number One. I knew.

That's why I cancelled my fishing trip.

Someone reminded me that maybe
I should celebrate with my friends.

Okay, next month for movie night,

I'm programming an Andorian comedy.

Mm-hmm. Turns out the secret
to getting Uhura to relax

is making it feel like work.

I believe you are going to be
her next project, Lieutenant.

God help me.

Mm, what exactly have we been
drinking for the last hour?

- [GRUNTS "I DON'T KNOW".]
- ORTEGAS: Orion hurricanes.

Caras gave us a bottle
of real Orion delaq,

so they're genuine.

Interesting flavor.

Does anyone else feel strange?

Why does everything feel
so... two-dimensional?

My arms don't normally do this.

My eyes feel huge. Do my eyes look huge?

ALL: Hmm... Hmm?

What the hell is in these things?!
