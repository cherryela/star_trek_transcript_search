Are you... yourself, sir?

Well, I'm very much myself.

That's the problem.

It was not lost on me
that when you went down

to the Klingon moon of Boreth,
you returned a changed man.

Boreth is notable for two things:

a monastery and a rare ore

that can cause temporal
consciousness displacement.

Both of which bear
the power of transformation.

It wasn't the monastery.

No. I assumed as much.

You saw the future?

I saw my own death, Spock.

At least the death of the man I am now.

I know exactly how and
when my life ends.

And I didn't just see it, I felt it.

Every agonizing second.

Most humans...

we like to think

that right until
the very last instant...

... somehow, some way,

we'll cheat death. (SHORT CHUCKLE)

At least I did.

Is it soon?

Only you could ask that question.

No.

It's almost a decade away.

Is that soon?

Suddenly that feels soon.

I can't stop seeing it.

Sir, I would suggest knowledge of death

is vital for effective leadership.

Knowledge is one thing, Spock,
but I experienced it.

How will it live in me?

Will it make me hesitant?

Cautious? Not cautious enough?

I'm already second-guessing myself.

And that's the last thing
a captain can afford.

Suffering can be
transformed into insight.

You must seek out the good
in knowing your own death.

Use it to be the man
you most essentially are.

And who's that, Spock?

The captain.

(SPEAKER CHIMES)

UHURA: Captain Pike to the bridge.

We're dropping out of warp.

Any sign of the Archer?

Getting her transponder ping

Take us around, Lieutenant.
Hail her. All frequencies.

Trying.

Nothing, sir.

Any chance we're losing her
response in sub-space chatter?

There is no sub-space chatter.

It's dead quiet out there.

We've got a visual, sir.

On screen.

MITCHELL: All systems show in the green.

Ship's perfectly intact, sir.

- PIKE: Life signs, Mr. Spock?
- SPOCK: None.

But neither am I detecting any bodies.

The ship is empty.

Where's her crew?

Fascinating.

I'm all ears.

It's a figure of speech.

I am remotely accessing
the ship's manifest.

Archer carried only Una
and two astrophysicists.

LA'AN: If she went to the surface,

she'd have headed
for the warp signature.

Can you locate it, Spock?

I have it, sir. Although...

Not really in the mood
for an "although" right now.

I'm having trouble locking on.
Its location may be shielded.

This warp signature's also got
a pretty weird signal variance.

Pretty weird?

Recommend deflector shields to full.

Any obviously defensive posture
is in direct violation

of first contact protocols.

No hails from the surface
or sub-space chatter.

No interplanetary traffic.

Not one orbital dock.

- What's your point?
- These people aren't showing

any signs of local space colonization.

Which puts them a century
behind constructing warp drive.

Yet they have a warp signature.

A nascent one.

- The anomaly is a red flag.
- Captain, there is not sufficient...

- Activate deflector shields.
- Aye.

ORTEGAS: Reading multiple
launches from the surface.

Plasma torpedoes. Three direct hits.

- Damage assessment?
- MITCHELL: Minimal.

But if we hadn't had our shields up...

Good call, Number One.

Take us up, Ortegas.

Maybe they'll think they got us.

What is going on down there?

Plasma torpedoes?

That's st-century tech.

How in the hell did these people develop

a faster-than-light engine?

They did not.

Recommend we go to red alert.

Red alert, Ms. Uhura.

- (ALARM BLARING)
- I have analyzed the signal variance

Lieutenant Ortegas isolated.

These people have not
built a warp drive.

Based on these readings,

they have built a warp b*mb.

It would seem there are
two warring factions.

And their conflict has escalated
to a crisis point.

Surface scans of the planet

are consistent with pre-warp society.

- How is that possible?
- SPOCK: As you know,

the Vulcans invented first contact.

As they never fail to remind us.

The worlds in this sector with warp.

All have or are in process

of being inducted into the Federation.

We are free to travel to any of them.

General Order does not apply.

Not on one of these worlds...

in fact, not once in the entire
history of first contact

has warp been first developed
as anything but a drive.

Put another way, the nuclear b*mb

could have been invented
before particle physics.

- It simply never has been.
- Would Number One have known

that the warp signature
was that of a w*apon?

Possibly not. Our scanners
were just updated in space dock.

LA'AN: If those m*ssile
are the best they've got,

let's beam down, find our
people, and bring them home.

We have to consider the possibility

that this technology isn't native.

However they got it,

if they found it in a crashed alien

spacecraft, if it was placed
in their hands...

- General Order applies.
- We cannot interfere

with their natural development.
We cannot show ourselves

- for risk...
- But if they've already seen us?

We cannot risk the possibility.

So we just leave our people there?

Hardly.

Let's go see the doctor.

Doc. Please, dispense some wisdom.

Okay.

Never get the house dressing.

(LAUGHS)

Ah.

Good to see you.

Dr. M'Benga toured the Mojave with me

- and I toured Kenya with him.

- And this is...
- A pleasure to see you again.

Of course.

You had to certify her for duty.

I received your orders, Captain.

This is Nurse Chapel.

Nurse Chapel is on civilian exchange

from the Stanford Morehouse
Epigenetic Project.

Sounds like you're just
the person for the job.

What job?

I'm gonna mess with your genome.

You first.

The locals are humanoid.

They're a close match
to most of the crews'

physiology and genetics.

But we'll need to make

a few alterations
if you want to blend in.

Internally, they have a bunch

of different organs that would

take a lot longer to change, so...

just try not to get an X-ray.

Change how, exactly?

Nurse Chapel is part
of Starfleet's initiative

to better observe alien cultures
without contamination.

You make disguises.

And you boss a rocket ship,

if, you know, we're going
all simplistic here.

I make minor alterations

to your genetic code

and induce internal celerity to express

short-term changes to your biology.

Is it safe?

Almost every time.

Sedative first.

Your body is going
to undergo compressed,

jury-rigged metamorphosis.

It's... painful.

Damn the ramparts, Doctor.

It means go ahead.

(CHUCKLES): Okay.

CHAPEL: I modified it for you.

But Vulcans are more complex

and your half-human genome is unique.

So...

it might not last as long
the first time.

No sedatives. Just the gene therapy.

CHAPEL: Maybe I wasn't clear about

the... the terrible pain part?

Maybe I wasn't clear when I said no.

So...

I've read your file. Um...

- I think I understand...
- Are you giving me

a direct order to allow sedation

during this procedure, Captain?

I am not.

Then I prefer to remain fully aware.

People survive things.

Well, there's surviving...

and then there's living.

It's your choice.

Hang in there, sister.

Local clothing patterns
have been downloaded

into the buffer as well
as universal translators

What did you just say?

LA'AN: Sorry, Captain.

Just something my father said
not long before he...

Well, you read my file.

You know the Gorn captured
my family's colony ship

and deposited us on one of their...

planetary nurseries.

Didn't understand
what he meant at first.

But I had a lot of time
to think about it.

About why I was the only one to survive.

Do you know what I saw on the faces

of so many of the people
I loved as they d*ed?

Before they were slit open
and fed on alive

or used as breeding sacks?

Do you know the last thing they felt?

Surprise.

- Yes.
- Because right up until

the last moment, they...

couldn't imagine dying.

Yes.

But not you.

No. Not me.

Hi.

Sorry to interrupt.

I'm Christopher Pike.

My world is called Earth.

And though it's far from here,
uh, my people and yours

are, uh, very much alike.

This is my world today.

But we were not always peaceful.

This is Earth in our st century.

Before everything went wrong. It's a lot

like your world today. Recently I was

treated to a glimpse of my future.

It was not all I'd hoped.

After all, what good is there
in knowing your future?

A friend of mine asked
me that recently and...

... didn't understand what he
meant. (SHORT CHUCKLE)

Until now.

I've seen my future.

Let me show you yours.

Our conflict also started
with a fight for freedoms.

We called it the Second Civil w*r,

then the Eugenics w*r,

and finally just World w*r III.

This was our last day.

The day the Earth
we knew ceased to exist.

What began as an eruption in one nation,

ended in the eradication of ,

species of animals and plants

and % of Earth's population.

Global su1c1de.

What we gave you

is the means to exterminate yourselves.

And from the looks of you,

you're gonna do it.

You'll use competing ideas of liberty

to b*mb each other to rubble,
just like we did,

and then your last day
will look just like this.

Perhaps, somewhere, all your ends

are written as indelibly as mine.

But I choose to believe

that your destinies are still your own.

Maybe that's why I'm here...

to remind you

of the power...

of possibility.

Maybe that's the good
in-in seeing my future...

that I might remind you that,
right up until the very end,

life is to be worn gloriously.

Because, till our last moment...

... the future's what we make it.

So...

... go to w*r with each other.

Or...

... join our Federation of Planets...

... and reach for the stars.

The choice is yours.

You're not really supposed to survive.

Dumb luck the King Jr. ran into me.

Una was an ensign on the King.

She helped me find my way back home.

She's the reason I joined Starfleet.

I was worried that
you would question my ability

You were worried I wouldn't trust you.

- Yes.
- So,

you decided not to trust me instead.

I was wrong.

I'm-I'm sorry.

Your record is spotless.

But...

there's more to serving Starfleet

than just individual excellence.

Our ability to work together...
that's our greatest strength.

Other people are...

Mm.

You know how those domes got up here?

- No, sir.
- Well,

during World w*r III,
a group of scientists

sent seed pods into space,
to preserve them.

But when the w*r was over
and Earth had rebuilt,

the forests were too large
to bring home.

So, Starfleet built
its first base around them.

is possible.
