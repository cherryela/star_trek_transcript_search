UHURA: Communications officer's log,

stardate . .

Traveling in the far edges
of the Alpha Quadrant,

we have encountered
an unusual phenomenon:

a naturally-occurring subspace fold.

Lieutenant Spock
posits it could be used

to triple the speed
of subspace communications

in the sector. But his experiment

requires so much computer power

that the rest of the ship
has to communicate...

Hailing frequencies open.

...the old-fashioned way.

On it.

[OVERLAPPING COMMS CHATTER]

I'll route that right to you.

Pike to Uhura. Have you
hailed Captain Batel?

Hailing now, Captain.

I'll send her to your quarters
when I have her.

Transporter to Uhura.
Has the USS Farragut

confirmed Lieutenant
James Kirk's arrival?

Checking on that now, Commander.

CHAPEL: Medical to Uhura.

Is there a message from Dr. Korby yet?

Just arrived. Standby.

SPOCK: Engineering to Uhura.

Are you ready to continue
our experiment?

Yes, Lieutenant, momentarily.

[BONES cr*ck]

You want to go to Crivo for
our first vacation together?

I know it's cliché...

And touristy.

Chris, I have always wanted to see

the Crivian Planetary Museum,
and there are day trips

to the Glass Islands and Smoke Lakes...

I know you love a lake.

What's wrong?

Uh, maybe the timing is bad.

I-I'm just not sure
I can get away right now.

Is there something you're
not telling me, Chris?

'Course not. No. Uh...

But let's just put a pin in planning

for a few days.

Whatever you want. I'll be here.

[COMM CHIMES OFF]

UNA: Lieutenant Kirk's captain

sent a report in advance of his arrival.

"Show him the ropes.

Kirk's full of talent
but still has one or two issues

to work out before
he begins his commission".

Yeah. Punctuality being one.

[CLEARS THROAT]

You have... an energy.

What? I'm just waiting
for our visitor to arrive

so I can run
a security clearance on him.

I'm aware, but you came in here hot.

On fire.

It's making me sweat.

I-I'm fine. This is just
standard operating procedure.

Lieutenant Kirk! Welcome
back to the Enterprise.

Thank you, Commander.

No Sam? Thought he'd be here.

He's busy. We'll find him later.

Thank you for agreeing to do this.

Even if it's not fully necessary.

When I took my commission,
I spent a week shadowing Pike.

It made all the difference.

Hopefully it'll do the same
for you on the Farragut.

Good to see you again, La'An.

You still owe me that drink,

- if I'm not mistaken.
- UNA: You...

know each other?

Um...

ye-yes, but I-I still need
to do a security clearance.

Lead the way.

[QUIETLY]: Oh, sorry. I...

[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

[INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER P.A.]

And what if it's another rejection?

Forget those Vulcans
and their science academy.

They don't deserve you.

Ah, but this fellowship is different.

Dr. Korby's a genius.

ORTEGAS: Am I supposed
to know who that is?

He's the Louis Pasteur
of Archaeological Medicine.

Yeah, no. Still means nothing.

It means that thousands of people apply

for this fellowship every year

and only five are accepted.

This could change my life.

Okay.

Oh... Oof.

You got it. I knew it.

[LAUGHING]

M'BENGA: What will I do without you
for three months?

[CHUCKLES]: Oh, my God.

You're not the only one
who's gonna miss her.

Oh, I have to talk to Spock.

SPOCK: Unfortunately we have had
another communication failure.

That's our th attempt
at sending a message

through the subspace fold.

PELIA: ... that's not exactly

what I would call a lucky number.

What makes you think
that this particular fold

will lead to faster communication?

Frequencies propagate through it
three times faster than normal.

- Ah.
- With our current relay network,

it takes weeks to send a message
across the quadrant.

Imagine being able to do it in moments

and getting a near-instant reply.

Real-time communication
across thousands of light years.

Only, so far, no one's heard us.

[DRY CHUCKLE]

[UHURA HUMMING A TUNE]

Have you tried sending music through?

SPOCK: We have not.

Do you believe music may
yield a different result?

Well, you are trying to communicate

through a medium with different

laws of physics, so perhaps

fundamental harmonics
are the answer. Hmm?

You know, it was just a thought.

But perhaps an excellent one.

You pick the song, Nyota.

Well, let's see if subspace is a fan

[CHORUS VOCALIZING]

PIKE: Space.

The final frontier.

These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

Its five-year mission:

to explore strange new worlds...

... to seek out new life

and new civilizations,

to boldly go where no
one has gone before.

♪ ♪

[POP CHORUS VOCALIZING
STRANGE NEW WORLDS THEME]

♪ ♪

♪ ♪

So... that happened.

Reports of musical outbreaks
have come in from every deck.

Honestly, I assumed it was
something you had all rehearsed,

but I sang, too.

So did I.

And I do not sing.

The surge came from your subspace fold.

Help me connect the dots.

We sent a series
of transmissions through.

The final one was a song.

You sent in a song, and then we all...

- sang?
- Why are we singing?

I believe the song created
a resonant frequency

and dislodged something from the fold,

a quantum uncertainty field.

Okay, why would that make us sing?

Imagine an area of space where
quantum uncertainties collapse

so rapidly and randomly
that new realities are created.

In one such reality,
people sing uncontrollably.

PELIA: A musical reality.

Indeed.

So, what's next... more improbability?

Or will we just suddenly
poof into bunnies?

I would prefer
not to be a bunny, either.

SPOCK: I doubt we will be bunnies,

but we may not be done with singing.

Simulations reveal
we have become tethered

to this particular improbability field.

Attempting to fly out
would likely make it wider.

PELIA: It looks like a zipper,

which begs the question:

might it function like a zipper?

PIKE: Zippers work both ways. Could we

use it to close the improbability field

- back inside the fold?
- SPOCK: Potentially.

If we combined shield harmonics
with the Heisenberg compensator.

You would have to connect both
to the deflector array

and generate a beam.

That means connecting them manually.

Let's do it, uh, we don't know

how all this singing will affect us,

and I'd rather not find out.
Best to nip it in the bud.

Mr. Spock, you explained that very well.

I almost understood it.

SPOCK: Our zipper beam
must precisely match

the resonance of the fold.

What was the exact frequency
of the song we sent through?

UHURA: One moment.

Is that transmission
regarding Nurse Chapel's

recent fellowship application?

Was the news... favorable?

I don't look at personal correspondence.

Of course. That would be unethical.

You and Nurse Chapel have
become close, haven't you?

I suppose it would be accurate to say

that we are more than colleagues.

[CHUCKLES]

There's that classic Vulcan
romance I've heard about.

Why don't you ask her about it?

Of late, our communication
has faced challenges.

Mm.

UNA: Number One to Uhura.

Lieutenant Kirk and I are in place.

Stand by for harmonics data.

One junction down.

Only four more to go.

Don't tell me you've
run out of steam already.

You know, my brother...
he always described you

as "the first officer that
I thought I should be like".

Someone who keeps a necessary
distance from her crew

because she knows
she has to make hard decisions.

I'm aware of the reputation
I've had on this ship,

but recently,
I'm trying a new approach...

more hands-on.

My last first officer
definitely kept his distance.

And no one questioned him.

I call that style of command
a first mistake.

When people sing, they are confessing

highly personal...

emotional information.

Lieutenant, are you telling me

our emotions constitute
a security thr*at?

I am.

Well, whatever you're not saying,

hope it doesn't come to that.

Mr. Spock and Ensign Uhura
have a plan to shut it down.

[BOATSWAIN'S WHISTLE BLOWS]

Captain, we have adjusted
the Heisenberg compensator

to combine with shield harmonics
and collapse the musical reality

back into our standard quantum state.

Lieutenant Kirk, not to
rush you, but I'm rushing you.

The sooner we close the fold,

the faster we can say
goodbye to the music.

- Copy that, Ensign.
- Copy that, Ensign.

She was talking to me.

- You don't know that.
- I do know that.

I actually work here.

This isn't even your department.

You're xenoanthropology.

I was assigned here at your request.

She said you missed me.

Everything's connected to the deflector.

Ready to go, Nyota.

- UNA: Deflector aligned and ready to fire.
- PIKE: On your command,

It's closing.

Good work, all.

- [ALERT CHIMES]

It appears to be another energy surge.

[RUMBLING]

Somehow I don't think we zipped it.

Spock, what happened?

Unable to determine.

Incoming hail from the Cayuga.

When it rains.

Spock, find a way to determine it.

What just happened?
Why did I admit all that?

I told you.

This is a security thr*at.

But-but the singing... I... The...

How did that happen on the Cayuga, too?

Because the improbability field
is expanding...

... across the whole subspace
communications network.

To the entire fleet.

UNA: Admiral April's
last message confirmed

that the improbability field

has now spread to Federation ships.

He let me know in a
surprisingly beautiful baritone

that he wants us
to stop this now, by the way.

Do we have any idea why
this reality's compelling us

to confess our deepest emotions?

UHURA: I have a theory.

I think since we're
in a musical reality,

we're actually following
the rules of musicals.

So, when do characters in
musicals usually begin to sing?

When their emotions are so heightened

that words won't suffice.

UHURA: This musical reality
wants us to sing

about what's most pressing on our minds.

These emotions have the power

to overwhelm our capacity
for rational thinking.

They also have the potential
to drive us apart.

PIKE: The subspace fold...

I think we should blow it up.

Use the photon torpedoes
to bring down the curtain

- on this thing for good.
- That has potential.

- Really?
- Since we are the focal point

of this subspace fold,

a matter/antimatter blast
might untether the Enterprise

and reverse the musical reality
for all affected.

But it would be prudent
to test this theory

in a controlled environment,

in case it is more expl*sive
than intended.

What if we could isolate
and transport...

Subatomic particles from the fold.

Sorry.

I shouldn't have interrupted you

because you had that thought first.

UNA: Locking in on something that small

would require cross-targeting.

It's a two-person job.

Well, luckily you have
two persons right here.

UNA: You're refusing an assignment?

This isn't like you, La'An.

That's the problem.

I'm not behaving like myself.

None of us are.

You're afraid of singing.

- To James.
- What?

You can stop hiding it.

I see how you act around him.

What-what do you mean? I'm...
How-how do I act around him?

You don't want me to answer that.

Okay.

Hypothetically, let's say
I have feelings for him,

and those feelings pose an actual

space-time security risk.

I should just tell him.

That's the responsible thing to do.

Before it happens outside of my control.

I should just suck it up,
stop being a child

and just do it.

Do we have a lock on the target?

The molecular imaging scanner
can't focus the signal.

Adding power.

Isolating particles

Got it.

Confirmed.

Lieutenant Spock, I have the particles.

They're coming your way.

SPOCK: Acknowledged. Ready to receive.

KIRK: Transporting subspace
particles to Engineering.

Wow.

That was exciting.

I mean, Spock and Uhura
get to blow it up,

which is the real fun part, but, uh...

We make a good pair.

We should team up more often.

Lieutenant, um...

Jim.

Jim?

- Sounds so serious.
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

I, um...

[BOOMING]

What was that?

PIKE: If hitting just a few
subatomic particles

nearly blew up Engineering...

SPOCK: f*ring on the field
would be devastating.

As you can see in this simulation,

the expl*si*n would propagate

through the entire
Federation subspace network,

destroying everything.

It would be like soaking the
improbability field in kerosene

and holding a match to it.

Then we need a plan C.

Sir, I'm getting a hail.

Don't answer. We can't risk
spreading this further.

I am triangulating the source.

There appears to be
an incoming warp signal

heading our way fast.

The signal has Klingon encryption.

The last thing anyone wants
is singing Klingons.

Uhura, send a message by proxy
order of Starfleet Command.

Tell them they must
turn around immediately.

They've stopped hailing, but
I'm getting a message back.

The improbability field's
already hit them.

Standby for playback.

This is General Garkog of the
Imperial Klingon Defense Force.

Your evasion raises much suspicion.

We have located the abominable

source of our dishonor

and will destroy it immediately.

Make no attempt to stop us.

They're going to fire on the fold.

Their ship will be here in two hours.

I've hailed them repeatedly.
They refuse to answer.

If they complete their mission,
everyone affected

by the improbability field
will be destroyed.

So, just the entire Federation
and half the Klingon Empire.

We have to stop them at all costs.

Number One, analysis?

Well, striking them first
would constitute an act of w*r.

PIKE: Not much choice here, I'm afraid.

What if we just find a way to
disable their disruptor cannons?

And their torpedo launchers.

That's a lot to disable
before they get off a sh*t.

We need a tactical strategy
immediately. La'An?

On it.

And you. You're with me.

Partners again.

I like it. Let's go.

PIKE: Mr. Spock, Uhura,

what are the odds we can shut
down the improbability field

before the Klingons get here?

Not good. At least,
according to the data we have.

Then find new data.

You both need to fix this.

You're applying old rules
to a new reality.

I suggest you find
a different tempo, fast.

Studying the songs
themselves. Brilliant.

Not just the songs but the frequencies

the moment a song begins.

If we can isolate a pattern
in the improbability field

we might learn how to generate
an improbability-breaking event.

Now, how to trigger a song?

Well, per our musical rules,

we just need to wait until someone

- feels overwhelming emotion.
- [DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

- [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- You know...

like that.

To our brilliant friend Christine.

Oh, I feel weird celebrating

with everything going on.

I mean, we can't put our lives on hold

every time the ship's in trouble.

We could, but that wouldn't be fun.

Some of us need fun to deal with

- the constant thr*at of dying.
- ORTEGAS: Point is

we're here to celebrate your win.

So deal with it.

Logic would dictate you are toasting

good news regarding your fellowship,

so allow me to...

offer congratulations.

Was it an oversight

I met another you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

but I'm pretty sure

you're about to break a big one.

The other you, he, um...

He saw the real me.

Beyond my name, beyond
all that name stands for.

He'd never even heard it before.

And I-I liked it.

I liked the way he looked at me.

Because through his eyes,
I could finally see the person

I had the potential to be.

And it was someone

who wasn't burdened by...

tragedy and darkness.

Someone who could find hope
and live in that hope.

Someone free-free to feel and-and...

... take chances and, um...

And make connections.

But then, uh...

he was gone, and with him,

that version of myself was gone, too.

And... that's...

that was what I wanted to say.

Am I anything like the other me?

No.

And-and yes.

I like how you look at me, too.

In what way?

Like you really see me.

I'd be lying if I said

I didn't feel the connection, too.

When you first called me...

... I felt like I knew you.

But I'm not that James Kirk.

Of course, it was
inappropriate, and I am...

No, La'An, you don't understand, my...

my life is complicated.

Not time-travel complicated, but

I'm in a relationship.

A sometimes relationship,

and right now is one of those times

in a very real way.

- My God, if I'd have known, I...
- How could you have?

I actually think you'd like Carol.

You're both dedicated
to your jobs, intensely.

She's a scientist on Starbase One.

I tend not to stay in the same place

for very long, which is...

... a growing problem,
because Carol is...

... pregnant.

Oh, um...

Wow.

[SIGHS] Here you are.

I have been analyzing
the data we gathered.

Great. Uh, let me help.

Looking for a pattern,

only...

there is none.

I didn't expect Christine
to be so definitive

about ending our arrangement.

Uh... relationships

can be difficult,

Spock, and you're Vulcan.

But I am also human.

I feel things differently.

Bigger.

I see her logic, and yet...

I am hurt.

I am left behind.

[SHORT CHUCKLE]

Look. It's a pattern.

Every time someone sings, the state

of quantum improbability
in the field spikes.

It's almost imperceptible,
but it's there.

- So I ran the simulations,
- [DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]

and if we can get this spike to

giga electronvolts...

SPOCK: It would shatter the field.

You found the
improbability breaking event.

Great. So how do we
make this event happen?

Because our sensors just clocked

two more K't'inga battle cruisers

headed this direction.

Well, so far, we've only
witnessed people

being torn apart by this event.

But song can also be communal.

People worship with song.

Sailors use song
to help them row together.

People celebrate with song.

When I sang with Christine
in the Port Galley.

- CHAPEL:♪ Life through ♪
- SPOCK: A spike of

- ♪ Camera obscura... ♪
- electronvolts.

And that was just a solo
with backup vocals.

Maybe four voices, max.

- So we need to do that again,
- [MUSIC STOPS]

but with more. A lot more.

You mean like an ensemble number, or...

Not just an ensemble number.

A grand finale.

We need melodies and harmonies

with tone ratios that achieve

both algorithmic and logarithmic balance

on a mass scale.

What I'm saying is

the whole crew needs to sing together.

SPOCK: Our challenge is how
to inspire crew members

to spontaneously sing
in thematic unison.

A song cannot be triggered
without an emotional purpose.

Well, that sounds to me like a job

for a communications officer.

I can't possibly inspire
the entire ship to sing.

Oh, yes, you can.

You see the connections between us

when all we see are...

the empty spaces.

Help them to feel

the way they need to to sing.

Attention all crew,
this is your captain.

I know our situation
has been challenging,

and we might not all have been acting

like a, well...

like a crew.

But we'll get through this, together,

by following one voice:

the voice of the Enterprise.

Ensign Uhura?

[CLEARS THROAT]

Hi, everyone.

Uh, you might not all know me,

but I know you.

So, allow me to introduce myself.

Ensign Nyota Uhura,

your communications officer.

I used to think of myself

as always alone,

but not on this ship.

Because each of us,
we're connected as a crew.

[MOUTHS]

Do you know the odds

of all of us being here

on the Enterprise at this time?

It's improbable,

and yet

here we are, together,

I told Kirk the truth.

- How'd it go?

Not great. I, uh...

It was really hard.

And it hurt.

It usually does.

I'm glad I took that chance.

Maybe, um...

BATEL: You know, I don't need

Just relax. Enjoy it.

I promise you, even Julia Child's

boeuf bourguignon itself
will not make me forget

that you sang about lying to me.

Why didn't you just tell me
you hate the idea of Crivo?

I don't hate the idea.

Okay, yes, it sounded like my nightmare.

I just pictured something quieter.

Camping somewhere.

Chris, this isn't gonna work

if you're not more comfortable
being honest with me.

Even about something
as small as a vacation.

You got to trust me more than that.

You got to trust us.

I know. You're right.

Well, I have good news and bad news.

We have more time to plan
our compromised trip.

I just got put on
a priority one mission.

Hmm.

[TAPS Kn*fe]

Now, how do I know...

you're not the one making excuses now?

Well...

When I'm back, we'll go somewhere

we both want to go.

But no camping, unless
it comes with room service.

[CHUCKLES]

Deal.

UHURA: Communications
officer's log, supplemental.

I am happy to report that
all Federation vessels

have checked in and are behaving
normally once again.

As for the Klingons,

Lieutenant Spock engaged
in successful diplomacy

over some bloodwine.

Otherwise, it's back

to business as usual around here.

- [CONSOLE CHIMES]
- USS Nimerfro, this is Enterprise

acknowledging receipt
of your transmission.

- You fly safe out there.
- FEMALE: Acknowledged, Enterprise.

- [BOATSWAIN'S WHISTLE BLOWS]

it occurs to me that we'd be served

by sharing our findings with
non-Federation ships, too.

See who's nearby and open a channel.

Copy that, sir. I'll scan the area.
