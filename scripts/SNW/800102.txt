Well, you're posted

he's your new boss.

Captain Pike.

Lieutenant La'An Noonien-Singh.
Chief of Security.

We seek out new life

and new civilizations.

We boldly go where no

UHURA: Cadet's log.

Stardate . .

The Enterprise is
surveying the Persephone system,

where the crew is studying the behavior

of an ancient comet, C/ -Quentin.

I, however, am doing rotation

in landing party readiness protocols,

which doesn't really involve comets,

ancient or otherwise,

so duties are pretty slow at the moment.

Except, of course, for a
recent invitation to dinner

at the captain's cabin, for
which I have been encouraged

by Lieutenant Ortegas

to dust off my dress uniform.

(SIGHS)

You said it was formal.

Actually, what I said was you...

might want to wear your dress uniform.

Are you kidding? This is
your idea of a practical joke?

Kind of.

I'm going back to change.

You do not want to be late
to the captain's table.

(UHURA SIGHS)

Relax, Cadet. It's tradition.

- Hazing the newbie?
- All in good fun.

We get bored. It's a small ship.

You know, it's really not.

Come on.

Consider it your first complete square

in Enterprise bingo.

- You know about that?
- I was a cadet once too, Cadet.

So, what are these things like?

Well, first off, they're
not just the command crew.

Captain wants, you know, regular people,

to hear what's actually
happening on the ship,

so he'll probably ask you questions.

Great.

That a problem?

How do I put this?

My father liked to say
that I was unburdened

by conversational boundaries.

So, this'll be fun for you, then.

(DOOR CHIMES)

(DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN)

Lieutenant Ortegas, Cadet Uhura, wel...

No.

You have offended Hemmer,

No offense intended.

I was raised to offer help to anyone

with a sensory impairment.

- If I was...
- That word again.

Sir?

"Impaired."

A human in my condition might
consider themselves impaired.

Hemmer may not be able to see,
but his other senses compensate.

HEMMER: Compensate? They are superior.

Uh, I've read that, among many things,

the Aenar have a form
of precognitive ability.

I knew you were going to ask that.

Because you sensed my
question before I asked it?

Because everyone always asks that.

Right.

HEMMER: You telegraphed
your throw, telepathically.

As was my intention, to illustrate.

This is a hazing thing, isn't it?

You guys are screwing around.

(QUIET LAUGHTER)

I move after him, only I
trip, flat on my face. I shout,

"Freeze!" But the
Nausicaan keeps running.

pulls me aside and says,

"Maybe Security isn't the
best fit for you, Ensign."

(LOUD LAUGHTER)

I've never understood
the human inclination

to laugh at others' misfortune.

What's that you're humming, Cadet?

Sorry. Bad habit.

Uh, it's an old folk song
from my village in Kenya.

I've visited Lake Simbi
Nyaima several times.

It is achingly beautiful there.

- I grew up just a few miles away.
- Really?

You know, the Enterprise
only gets a handful

of cadets a year from Starfleet.

You got to be pretty
impressive to make the cut.

Thank you, sir.

I hear you speak languages.

Uh, .

PIKE: Okay, wow.

Uh, in Kenya we have
native languages.

I found early that, if I
wanted to be understood,

it's best to communicate
in someone's own tongue,

so I learned them.

Easy as that?

For me, sir, yes.

I noticed you're on the
next landing party rotation.

I know it can be confusing

jumping from department to department.

- Right, Number One?
- That was one time.

(LAUGHTER)

I'm sure you've chosen
a specialty you'd like.

Where do you see yourself in ten y...

Ten years, where do you see yourself?

UHURA: Are you asking me what I want

to be when I grow up, Captain?

Sure.

I...

... guess the truth is, I'm not sure

I'm actually all that "Starfleet."

That's not something I've
ever heard from a cadet.

You worked pretty hard to get here.

You b*at out, how many,
a thousand applicants?

Several thousand.

PIKE: And now you're not
sure if you want to be here?

I always wanted to
study alien languages.

I have an ear for them.

And a gift for understatement.

I was going to attend
the University in Nairobi.

Both my parents taught there.

Mm-hmm.

About a week before I was due to start,

they were, uh...

k*lled in a shuttle accident.

My older brother, too.

I'm so sorry.

After, I just...

couldn't go to campus.

Their absence was...

everywhere.

I moved in with my grandmother,

but I just...

didn't feel like I fit

anywhere.

Anyway, she was in
Starfleet when she was young,

and she always used to talk about it,

and, well, I didn't
know what else to do.

So you ran away to Starfleet?

Yes.

That is an impressive and
heartbreaking story, Cadet.

That's me.

Well, Cadet, I appreciate your honesty,

and I sincerely hope
you discover a place

where you feel you do fit,

wherever that may be.

Guess I kind of blew it in there, huh?

Not at all, Cadet.

The captain values honesty, as do I.

But... ?

But I would say to you

that Starfleet has been
a lifelong dream for many,

myself included.

If it is not your path, you
might consider making way

for someone else who wants to walk it.

(SIGHS)

UNA: I've seen you ask that cadet

question a hundred times.

Tonight it felt different.

Is it because of what you told me,

about what you saw on Boreth?

Turns out, knowing your future

kind of takes the fun
out of imagining it.

Chris, have you considered that maybe

your fate isn't written?

Dusty Swender.

T'quiel Dawn. Muliq Al Alcazar.

Yuuto Hoshide. Andrea Lopez.

I could keep going. These are
the kids I save when it happens.

You know their names.

Lately, I've been saying
them over and over again,

like a reminder.

Stay the course, save their lives.

I refuse to believe
there isn't another way.

(COMM CHIMES)

SPOCK (OVER COMM): Captain
Pike to the bridge.

There is a problem with the comet.

SPOCK: The computer
simulation suggests that,

when the comet strikes
the planet in two days,

there will be no survivors.

Persephone III is an M-Class world.

Previous surveys suggests
it is home to an intelligent,

pre-warp species that
call themselves the Deleb.

Given their current state
of technological advancement,

it is highly unlikely that they're aware

- of the danger they are in.
- PIKE: Options?

The Deleb can't move the comet,

- so we move it for them?
- Mr. Spock?

An ion engine. To be precise, four,

programmed to fire in sequence

to account for the comet's rotation.

Got it. Number One, thoughts?

It could work.

We could use photon
torpedoes as launch vehicles.

Take about an hour for the retrofit.

A rosy assessment,
considering I'll be the one

doing the retrofitting.

Let's get it done, people.

We've got a planet to
save before breakfast.

I love this job.

Anyone want to tell me how a comet

puts up a force field?

PIKE: Space.

The final frontier.

These are the voyages of
the starship Enterprise.

We've tried every hail,
every scan you can think of.

If there's life on the
comet, we can't find it.

But we did find...

a structure.

It's enormous and mostly subterranean.

A structure suggests alien intelligence.

Which is why I've asked Sam
Kirk of Xenoanthropology here

to join us. So, let's
start with the obvious.

It looks like a comet, has
shields like a starship,

and a building on its
surface like a planet,

but no life signs.

Maybe it's not a comet at all,

but some kind of derelict spacecraft?

Okay, so how do we
shut down its shields?

Logic suggests this structure
is likely where we'll have to go.

Except it's got shields.

The shields are not constant.

They only appear in
response to a thr*at.

It should be possible
to beam to the surface

without triggering them.

Sam, are you aware of any civilization

that developed on the
surface of a comet?

First I've heard of one.

I'm starting to like the mustache.

Maybe you should try one for yourself.

La'An, you, Spock,

and Sam get suited up, and

this is the cadet's first away mission.

You wanted to learn to
speak alien languages...

go where the aliens are.

The surface of the comet is b*mb

by ridiculously high
levels of cosmic rays.

This will buy you two hours.

Any more and your insides
will turn to liquid.

Ow!

Ugh, you could've warned me.

Then you'd know it was gonna hurt.

You know I've had people run on me?

We are the Shepherds.

Really?

That's how the universal translator

We escort M'hanit.

M'hanit is far more than a comet.

M'hanit is one of the
ancient arbiters of life.

Okay.

If you tamper with it again,

we will not hesitate to destroy you.

Scan the ship.

What kind of w*apon
are we dealing with?

Our intentions were not hostile.

M'hanit is on a collision
course with an inhabited planet.

We were simply trying
to divert its trajectory.

Absurd.

Would you adjust the height of the waves

or the position of the stars?

M'hanit's course is preordained.

There are millions of
people on that planet.

The impact will k*ll them all
and likely blow your comet...

Uh...

Blow your M'hanit
into just as many pieces.

SHEPHERD CAPTAIN: Are you
a reasonable man, Captain?

I-I'd like to think so, yes.

Then please entertain the proposition

that M'hanit is not,

as you continue to call him,

a comet.

It is an instrument,

an ancient arbiter,

one of the few remaining in the galaxy.

If it is his will to move, he will move.

If it is his will to bring life,

he will bring life.

If M'hanit wills

the planet to die, even
chooses to die with it,

then that is what will happen.

As I said, it is preordained.

Blowing up a planet full of
people is not preordained...

You said you were a
reasonable man, Captain.

So how can you know? Since before

our distant ancestors touched
the sky and the stars beyond,

my people have been charged

with the protection of the arbiters.

None of us even remember when
the charge first came to us,

but we accepted the mantle

with honor.

For centuries,

we have protected the arbiters
as they follow courses

set long before our suns

first b*rned in the sky,

bringing life across the galaxy.

It is not our prerogative
to interfere, Captain,

nor is it yours.

PIKE: Please, excuse me.

UNA: Their systems are
incredibly advanced,

their ships faster than ours,

Let's just say we don't
want to piss them off.

How exactly are we supposed to
move the comet without doing that?

We have to buy time
for the landing party

to get the force field down.

And hope these Shepherds don't find out

that they're down there.

I'm guessing they'd be
kind of touchy about that.

Ensign, resume communications.

You have your sacred duty. We have ours.

The Federation doesn't interfere
in the development of species,

but we also don't just let them die.

We don't mean to disrespect M'hanit.

We'd do the same for you
if you were in danger.

You say you don't interfere,
that you mean no disrespect,

but your crew has desecrated
the temple on his surface.

Music is just sound waves,

which can be represented by numbers.

What if the code is harmonics?

Someone help me out here.
I skipped music class.

Harmonics are just the
ratios between frequencies.

Every note vibrates at
a specific frequency.

Double that frequency,

and you get the same
pitch an octave higher.

That's the two in our code.

Triple the frequency, and
you get a perfect fifth.

Five times the frequency
is a major third.

The code is a major chord.

Why would an alien species

PIKE: Captain's log, supplemental.

I am left to wonder

who made the comet?

How many more like it are out there?

Was it coincidence that
fostered the chance

for more life on Persephone III?

Or something more?

Look, we already knew
how to turn musical notes

- into numbers, right?
- (DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT)

But the computer helped
me turn those numbers

into numerical coordinates.

You're saying the
numbers painted a picture?

UHURA: Yes. But not just any picture.

The music contained this image.

This is a star chart
showing the comet's course,

a course that includes it
moving past Persephone III.

You are suggesting the
comet was telling us

- it did not intend to hit Persephone III?
- Yes.

It meant no harm.

That was the message.

But if I had not interfered,

it would have destroyed the planet.

Okay, here's where things get weirder.

When we zoom in on the
image, we find this shape.

And this is an image of the chunk of ice

that broke off from the comet as
Lieutenant Spock flew his mission.

- They're identical.
- UNA: You're saying the comet sent this message

before Spock was able to
correct the comet's course?

We recorded it hours earlier.

SPOCK: It is highly improbable

the comet could have randomly guessed

the shape the ice that fell off
would take with such accuracy.

Unless your flight was foretold.

You're suggesting the comet had
foreknowledge of future events?

The comet's flight path and
its, I don't know, mission

to seed that planet was predicated

on you flying that shuttle to move it.

It knew its fate, you might say.

Thank you for your report, Cadet.

Cadet Uhura.

As I said, many dream of
being worthy of Starfleet,

of representing its values

- of selflessness, courage, sacrifice.
- I know it shouldn't have been me

- down there...
- I have not finished, Cadet.

The odds of us surviving were,

in fact, quite low.

No pep talk could have increased them.

I understand you did
not come to Starfleet

the way many of us have.

That you are not sure you wish to stay.

But, having observed
your actions on the comet,

I am certain, should you choose to,

Starfleet would be fortunate
to have an officer like you.

Thank you, sir.

(EXHALES)

A little piece of ice and
dust roaming through space

brings life.

I bet you not one of us
could have predicted how.

(PIKE GRUNTS SOFTLY)

I'll give you that.

So, just because you receive
a message from the future

doesn't mean you understand it.

We're not talking about
the comet anymore, are we?

Don't throw your life away, Chris.

- Number One...
- I know you had a vision of the future, but...

I made a choice.

I accepted my fate. It...

It goes beyond my own life.

What if you're wrong?

What if you got that message

so you could save those
kids and that's it?

What if you don't have
to ruin your life, too?

How do you know you can't
make a different choice?

One that saves all of you?

What if your fate

is what you make it?
